**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

### 1. How long will your company take for the fire damage restoration process?

There is no fixed timeline involved when it comes to our fire damage cleaning services. The whole process highly depends on the level of fire and how much area it has affected. The speed of fire restoration cleaning also depends on the materials that are present within the building.

In such cases, you can [call our expert technicians][Contact](/contact/) who will visit the property to examine the damage and give you a free quote and estimate timeline.

### 2. Will my home insurance policy cover the fire damage restoration?

Most of the home insurance policies provide complete cover for any sort of fire damage caused to the home.

Our fire restoration company has worked with several insurance companies in the past. They are aware of the whole procedure to get a claim from the insurance company for the fire. We provide the pictures & other related documents to the concerned insurance provider. Once the paperwork goes through, you can get the claim amount and reconstruct your house.

### 3. Can I Inspect my house after the fire ends?

We would suggest that you not take such risks in cases of big fires. There is a lot of structural damage that makes the house weaker and can lead to bad accidents.

It is best to let a licensed inspector or a structural engineer visit the property to examine the damage. The assessment helps in making a plan of action for us and gives you an estimate of the damage caused.

### 4. How can I put out a fire that is just starting?

In case of an electrical fire, disconnect the device from the main outlet to cut out the power source if it’s safe to do so. Try putting out the fire using a fire extinguisher. Don’t use water or foam fire extinguishers to put out electrical fires as both can act as a conductor of electricity.

If the material that caught fire is wood, paper, cloth, trash or plastic, then you can use a foam extinguisher or water to put out the fire. These will cut the heat supply to the materials.

For materials like alcohol, petroleum, gasoline, and paint, you have to use foam, powder, or carbon-dioxide extinguishers. These are known to cut the oxygen supply to the fire and put it out.

It is best to leave further investigation and remediation to expert fire damage restoration services.
