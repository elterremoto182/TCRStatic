## Indoor Air Quality

A person can spend 90% of a day indoors which is especially true during the hot and cold seasons. In addition to spending a large amount of time indoors, modern construction is more tightly sealed and insulated which means indoor pollutants can remain inside, creating an environment where the indoor air is up to five times more contaminated than the air outside.

Contaminants include harmful chemicals and toxins, dust mites, pollen, mold, and other unwanted air pollutants. Indoor air quality products like the products below are just some of the solutions available to help you and your family enjoy comfort and peace of mind.

## Whole-area air cleaners

### Indoor pollutants can cause problems

- Congestion
- Sneezing
- Headaches

A whole-area air cleaner can help remove these tiny particles, the potential for asthma and allergy attack triggers in your home or business. Air cleaners and HEPA filters can catch dust, pollen, pet hair and dander, dust mites, mildew, and more, leaving behind only fresh, clean air.

## Humidifiers

Humidifiers can help protect you, your family, and your home from the damaging effects of over-dry air with just the right amount of moisture. While temperature is often an important factor of any building’s comfort, dry air should also be considered especially during winter.

### Dry air can lead to

- Dry nose
- Cracked and itchy skin
- Sore throat
- Allergy and asthma symptoms
- Frequent static shocks
- Chipped paint and plaster
- Cracked wood floors, furniture, and trim

Dry air also makes the air temperature feel cooler, making your heating unit work overtime to reach the right comfort level.

Whether you need dehumidification, ventilation, filtration, or humidification, we offer durable and efficient products and solutions to help keep the air in your home cleaner and more comfortable.
