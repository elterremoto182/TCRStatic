# Shrink wrapping

Shrink wrapping serves as a layer of protection for roofs that are already damaged or at risk of being damaged from severe weather or other factors. Our professionals will work with you to determine if shrink wrapping is the best option for your needs.

## Reasons to Consider Shrink Wrapping your Roof

- Roof has been damaged
- Incoming winds, tornado, or hurricane
- Protect it against water damage and mold

## Expert Shrink Wrapping Installations

Our professional contractors have years of experience installing shrink wrap on properties of all sizes. We will measure the size of your roof to determine how much material is needed and then will properly install it.

## Shrink Wrapping Should be Completed by a Professional

Trying to tackle shrink wrapping yourself can be dangerous. It can also lead to further damage to your roof if not completed properly. We have years of experience completing shrink wrapping projects and you can feel confident that it will be installed properly the first time.

> Alexander's team at Total Care Restoration were nothing short of amazing. The team was always on time, respectful, clean. They protected my home as if it was their own to make sure that other damage did not occur. They explained everything in detail and took photos of every step. Words cannot express the gratitude my family and I will always have for Total Care Restoration and their entire team. We are immensely grateful.
