# Air quality inspections

Professional air quality inspections are critical to determine the air quality of your property. Having poor indoor air quality can lead to health problems and difficulty breathing. It is important to have regular testing completed by a professional.

## Professional Air Quality Inspections

Our contractors are fully certified to handle your indoor air quality inspection. Although we don’t offer lab reports, we will provide you with a solid direction on whether you will need a 3rd party testing company or not. 

## Signs You May Have Bad Air Quality in your Home

- Dry, itchy, watery eyes
- Asthma or other breathing problems
- Headaches
- Coughing/wheezing
- Dry skin or irritation
- Foul odor around around vents

## Don’t Complete an Air Quality Inspection Yourself

Home air quality inspection kits are not very accurate and often aren’t able to [detect mold][Tell Mold Behind Walls](/tell-mold-behind-walls/) and air quality levels accurately. We have access to the latest methods of testing to ensure the air in your home is safe to breathe.

> Alexander's team at Total Care Restoration were nothing short of amazing. The team was always on time, respectful, clean. They protected my home as if it was their own to make sure that other damage did not occur. They explained everything in detail and took photos of every step. Words cannot express the gratitude my family and I will always have for Total Care Restoration and their entire team. We are immensely grateful.
