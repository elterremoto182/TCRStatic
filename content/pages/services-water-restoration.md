**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

### 1. Will my home insurance policy cover the water damage repair costs?

Most of the insurance companies offer coverage for damages caused due to some water calamity. However, we advise you to consult with your agent before you can make any decision.

It is important to know the cause of water damage as some events involving weather might need special insurance clearance. This clearance is gained through the National Flood Insurance Program.

### 2. When will the odor disappear after your water damage restoration process?

After the water damage cleanup, it is not unusual to smell foul odor during the drying process. It is the smell of the carpet and other things drying up and they should not be confused with the smell of mold.

As the humidity and heat levels will change in the area, you’ll feel the foul smell disappearing from the room. Another effective way to get rid of the smell is by using deodorizers and room fresheners.

### 3. Can you save my furniture from the water damage?

The restoration for furniture depends on the extent to which the furniture is damaged. Once the drying process is complete, the furniture and other contents are assessed by our technicians. 

If the condition of the furniture and other belongings are unsalvageable, we will document the loss for you. Apart from this, we will take a signed document from you as a token of permission to dispose of the damaged goods.

### 4. What are the precautions I should take in an emergency water damage situation?

If you face an emergency water damage situation, here is a list of things that you should avoid doing to protect yourself. The precaution measures are-

- Don’t enter the room with standing water till the electricity main is not switched off.
- Don’t use home vacuum cleaner to take the water out from the area.
- Avoid using electrical appliances on wet surfaces and carpet.
- Immediately call for a professional cleaners service to avoid water and bacteria-growth.

### 5. What should I do if a water pipe bursts in the middle of the night?

In case a water pipe of your house bursts in the middle of the night, here are the things you can do to prevent any major losses.

- Turn off the main power supply
- Cut the electricity supply to the affected areas to avoid a case of electrical short circuit
- Move the paintings, furniture, and other things from the areas where the water has entered

Look for professional services that offer 24x7 emergency water damage service for water damage restoration.

It is essential to take these precautions to prevent any major disasters from taking place in the area.
