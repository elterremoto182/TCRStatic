## Assessing Your Home After a Storm

After a hurricane or major storm passes through South Florida, the urge to immediately inspect your property is strong. However, a systematic approach to damage assessment keeps you safe and ensures you document everything needed for insurance claims.

This guide walks you through the process from the moment it's safe to go outside until you've completed documentation for your insurance company.

## Before You Begin: Safety First

### Wait for All-Clear

Never begin inspection until:

- Officials declare it safe to be outside
- The storm has completely passed (not just the eye)
- Daylight allows proper visibility
- Conditions allow safe movement

### Personal Safety Equipment

Before going outside, prepare:

- Sturdy closed-toe shoes or boots
- Long pants and long sleeves
- Work gloves
- Flashlight (even during day, for interiors)
- Phone for photos and emergency calls
- First aid kit accessible

### Hazards to Watch For

During your assessment, constantly watch for:

**Electrical Hazards**
- Downed power lines
- Flooded areas near any wiring
- Damaged electrical panels
- Sparking or buzzing sounds

**Structural Hazards**
- Sagging roofs or ceilings
- Cracked or leaning walls
- Broken glass
- Weakened stairs or decks

**Other Dangers**
- Sharp debris
- Exposed nails
- Displaced wildlife (snakes, etc.)
- Contaminated standing water
- Gas leaks

## Exterior Assessment: Step by Step

### Step 1: Approach Carefully

Walk around your property perimeter first:

- Stay back from the structure initially
- Look for obvious structural damage
- Note any downed trees or large debris
- Check for gas odors
- Identify any immediate hazards

### Step 2: Roof Assessment (From Ground)

Look up at your roof from multiple angles:

**What to Look For**
- Missing shingles or tiles
- Lifted or curled roofing
- Visible holes or penetrations
- Damaged or missing flashing
- Debris on the roof
- Damage to ridge caps and vents
- Satellite dishes, antennas displaced

**Important**: Don't climb on your roof. Use binoculars if available. A professional should inspect up close.

### Step 3: Check Soffit and Fascia

These often show damage:

- Missing or dangling soffit panels
- Damaged fascia boards
- Water staining indicating intrusion
- Disconnected gutters

### Step 4: Windows and Doors

Inspect each opening:

- Broken or cracked glass
- Damaged frames
- Compromised seals
- Signs of water intrusion
- Damaged shutters (if applicable)

### Step 5: Siding and Exterior Walls

Check all exterior surfaces:

- Missing or loose siding
- Impact marks or punctures
- Cracks in stucco or masonry
- Paint damage or bubbling
- Signs of water behind siding

### Step 6: Garage and Outbuildings

Don't forget:

- Garage door damage
- Shed or outbuilding condition
- Pool cage or screen enclosure
- Fence damage
- Outdoor kitchen or structures

### Step 7: Grounds and Trees

Assess your property:

- Fallen trees and branches
- Leaning trees that could fall
- Root damage to foundations
- Debris accumulation
- Damage to driveways and walkways

## Interior Assessment

### Before Entering

Only enter if:

- Structure appears sound
- No strong gas odors
- No sagging ceilings or walls
- Floor appears stable
- No electrical hazards visible

### Systematic Interior Check

**Ceilings**
- Water stains (new or expanding)
- Sagging or bulging areas
- Cracks
- Fallen debris
- Active dripping

**Walls**
- Water staining
- Cracks or displacement
- Bubbling paint
- Moisture on surface
- Mold growth (may appear quickly)

**Floors**
- Standing water
- Warping or buckling
- Water marks on carpet
- Lifted tiles
- Moisture under flooring

**Windows and Doors (Interior Side)**
- Water pooled on sills
- Moisture between panes
- Damaged frames
- Signs of water entry

**Attic (If Safe to Access)**
- Daylight visible through roof
- Water staining on rafters
- Wet insulation
- Active leaks
- Displaced or damaged materials

## Documentation for Insurance

### Photography Guidelines

Take extensive photos:

**Overall Shots**
- Wide shots showing context
- Multiple angles of each damage area
- Distance shots showing extent

**Detail Shots**
- Close-ups of specific damage
- Damage with measuring reference (ruler/tape)
- Serial numbers of damaged appliances

**Before/After Reference**
- Photos showing pre-storm condition if available
- Social media posts with your home visible
- Real estate listing photos

### Written Documentation

Create a detailed list:

- Date and time of discovery
- Location of each damage area
- Description of damage
- Estimated extent
- Related damages (water from roof led to ceiling damage)

### Video Walkthrough

In addition to photos:

- Record continuous video of interior
- Narrate what you're seeing
- Show relationship between damage areas
- Include date/time stamp

### Preserve Evidence

Important steps:

- Don't throw away damaged items yet
- Keep damaged materials if possible
- Save any debris that caused damage
- Retain damaged appliances for adjuster
