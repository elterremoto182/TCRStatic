When it comes to the essential components of your home, the roof is arguably one of the most important. Obviously, it keeps you, your loved ones, and your valuables protected from the elements. Even the smallest roof leak can lead to major issues.

This includes potential water damage, but also higher utility bills due to requiring more power to cool/heat your space.

Unfortunately, many major instances of roof damage don’t come under the calmest of circumstances. Natural disasters and storms may leave you with a leak or hole in your roof. While you wait to get proper roof service, an emergency roof tarp can be the difference between safety and danger. Here’s what you need to know about this option.

## What Does An Emergency Roof Tarping Service Do?

Emergency roof tarping helps homeowners and property owners minimize the spread of damage after a bit of damage to your roof. To give you an idea, many roof leaks are negligible at first. There may be a small hole in the roof, but many homeowners don’t regularly check the area to notice, and if water damage is small and kept to an obscure area, like the attic, it may go unnoticed.

However, no leak remains small. Over time, the damage will increase, leading to a larger leak. This could result in significant water damage, higher utility costs to compensate for air loss through the leak, and potential structural risks. The main purpose of emergency roof tarping is to maintain a roof leak at its initial stage until someone can come out to repair it properly.

We accomplish this through several steps that unfold during the emergency roof tarping preparation and installation process.

To prepare for the tarp, you need to clear out any debris and assess the extent of the damage.

Next, you apply plywood to the damaged area before placing the tarp. This acts as a secondary line of defense in case the tarp fails.

Then, you place the tarp over the plywood and secure it with lumber.

Remember, the goal of an emergency roof tarp is not to “fix” a roof leak. It is not a substitute for a proper repair. Your home will still experience some losses in terms of water resistance and energy efficiency until you can fix the roof. The tarp’s role is to slow down the spread of any potential leaks or damage until a professional can repair the roof correctly.

The general lifespan of a [Roof Tarping](/roof-tarping/) is a few months, although some longer-lasting tarps can last a year or two. Make sure to inquire about the type of tarp you are getting when you have your tarp installed.

## Why Would You Need One?

  
So, when might someone need an emergency roof tarp? Natural disasters or major storms are typically the main reasons. In these events, many people often need help with damaged roofs at the same time.

As a result, local roofing companies might reach full capacity, and you could end up on a waiting list. An emergency roof tarp can provide some protection for your property and valuables until a roofer becomes available to assist you.

You might also be unsure whether you need to replace the entire roof or just a small section.

Although these are the primary reasons for emergency roof tarping, there are other scenarios as well. For instance, if you’re inspecting your home before selling it and discover a minor leak, it might be a good idea to use an emergency roof tarp. This will prevent any further roof issues until a professional can address it.

However, waiting to [Should I Install a Roof Tarp Now Or Wait to Replace My Roof](/should-i-install-a-roof-tarp-now-or-wait-to-replace-my-roof/) may cause water damage to your home.
