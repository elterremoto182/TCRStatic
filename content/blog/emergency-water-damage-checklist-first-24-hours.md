## Safety Check and Damage Review

Focus on safety first: water damage can conceal dangers like electrical issues, structural problems, and even wildlife.

### Safety Steps

Turn off power to any areas affected by water. If water has reached outlets, appliances, or the breaker box, contact a licensed electrician immediately. Never interact with electrical components in standing water.

**Essential protective gear:**

-   Rubber boots
-   Heavy-duty rubber gloves
-   Safety goggles
-   Battery-powered flashlight

If you encounter wildlife like ants or snakes, back away slowly and contact animal control for assistance.

**Structural concerns:** If you notice sagging ceilings or cracked walls, leave the area and consult a structural engineer.

### Assess the Damage

Look for these signs and respond appropriately:

-   **Sagging ceilings or walls:** Leave immediately and call a structural engineer.
-   **Water near electrical systems:** Get in touch with a licensed electrician.
-   **Contaminated water (e.g., sewage or floodwater):** Exit the area and hire water damage professionals.
-   **Cracked foundation:** Schedule a professional inspection without delay.
-   **Gas odor:** Leave the premises and call your gas provider.

Document the damage with photos and videos from a safe distance. (Refer to Insurance Documentation for guidance.)

Once it’s safe, gather all evidence and proceed with filing your insurance claim – details in Insurance Documentation.

## Insurance Documentation

Once you’ve assessed and documented the damage, it’s time to gather evidence for your insurance provider. Acting quickly and thoroughly ensures you have the necessary support for your claim while conditions remain unchanged.

### Photo and Video Evidence

Before starting any cleanup, take photos and videos of the damage. Be sure to cover every angle:

-   **Room-by-Room Shots**: Capture wide-angle views of each damaged room from different perspectives.
-   **Close-Ups**: Get detailed images of damaged walls, ceilings, furniture, and flooring.
-   **Structural Damage**: Photograph any water-damaged beams, drywall, or other structural elements.

### Inventory of Damaged Items

Create a detailed list of all affected items. Include descriptions, purchase dates, estimated values, and attach receipts if available.

### Contacting Your Insurance Company

-   Reach out to your insurance adjuster as soon as possible. Provide your policy number, details of the claim, and all supporting documentation.
-   Start the cleanup and drying process immediately – there’s no need to wait for the adjuster to arrive.


## Stop Further Damage

Once you’ve documented the damage, it’s important to act quickly to stop water from causing more problems. The longer water lingers, the worse – and more expensive – the damage gets.

### Removing Water

If the water isn’t contaminated, follow these steps after completing safety precautions: Use a wet/dry vacuum to remove standing water. For smaller puddles, mop them up or use towels to transfer the water into buckets.

### Drying Everything Out

1\. **Set up ventilation**  
Place fans to create cross-ventilation and run a dehumidifier in the center of the affected area.

2\. **Expose wall cavities**  
Take off baseboards and remove any water-damaged drywall to give the wall cavities a chance to dry out.

3\. **Prevent mold**  
Spray exposed wooden studs with a bleach solution (1 part bleach to 16 parts water) to help stop mold growth.

### Protecting Furniture

-   Lift furniture off the floor using blocks or bricks to prevent water damage to the legs.
-   Take out drawers from cabinets or dressers to help air circulate inside.
-   Dry furniture in a shaded area with good airflow to avoid warping or discoloration.
-   Use fans to keep air moving around damp furniture, but avoid applying direct heat.

For upholstered furniture, it’s best to hire professionals for drying. Once the area and items are fully dry, you’re ready to move on to getting expert help in the next steps.
