It is estimated that about 76 million homes in America have cast iron pipes that must be replaced.  These 76 million homes risk severe plumbing problems.

At a low estimated average of $10,000 per home, we are talking about **$760 billion** of damages an repairs that need to be made. This makes cast irons a massive problem for insurance companies.  

### **What is a Cast Iron Pipe?**

Cast iron pipes are a type of pipes that are have been in use for plumbing since the 17th century. They are made of Iron and due to do oxidation and sue they can slowly chip and slowly fall apart.

Common problems over the years can develop like:

-   Sewer Back Up Into Home
-   Roach Infestation
-   Pest Infestation
-   Slow Drains
-   Clogged Drains

This and many other types of damage can come due to pipe corrosion. These issues are not minor and most of the old cast iron pipes will show some of these issues.

## **Cast Iron Pipes In Florida**

In Florida alone, nearly two and a half million homes suffer from this problem and need urgent attention.

Although cast iron pipes have been used in many different water systems throughout the United States in the last hundred-plus years, they do deteriorate over time. In addition, they have a lifespan of only between 40 and 50 years. They can even begin to develop problems at 25 years old, depending on their certain circumstances.

Because of the salt and moisture-rich environment, Florida homes are especially susceptible to this type of pipe corrosion.

## **Does Homeowners Insurance Cover Cast Iron Pipes?**

If you had no previous knowledge that your pipes could deteriorate because they are made of cast iron, then you could have a claim.

However, insurance companies are notorious for giving lower reimbursements for cast iron claims, so be very careful. Sometimes the insurance company can take years to pay you your claim. They can even deny a claim completely, even though the policy technically covers it.

So you have to know your insurance coverage, and how to process the claim correctly.

TIP: **Always hire a public adjuster for a cast iron pipe claim**

Because of how many claims are denied, there is a class-action lawsuit that has been filed. Because so many people have experienced the cast iron problem, insurance companies are scrambling to stem the tide of claims and minimize their losses.

There are policies now that are excluding cast iron coverage, so make sure you understand your policy.

To top it off many policy rates are increasing, and providing minimal stop-gap coverage.

Always have a public adjuster explain to you your policy and your coverage before you start a claim.

## **Be Careful**

They are instead framing policyholder claims as fraudulent and using that to justify the denial of claims.

You can be left holding the bill even though you should be covered.

Policyholders have oftentimes been awarded insurance payouts 3 times higher than those without representation.
