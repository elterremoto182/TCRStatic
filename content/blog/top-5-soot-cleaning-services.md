This certification equips technicians to handle odors caused by biological decomposition, combustion, and chemical sources effectively. The OCT program includes 7 IICRC Continuing Education Credits, ensuring a deep understanding of the processes involved. This expertise allows Odorzx to implement solutions that eliminate odors at their source rather than just masking them.

### Custom Cleaning Plans

For both residential and commercial properties, Odorzx develops cleaning plans tailored to the specific damage and odor challenges identified during a detailed evaluation. The IICRC OCT certification is also a stepping stone to advanced qualifications, such as the [Air Quality Inspections](/services/air-quality-inspections/) designation.

## [SERVPRO](https://www.servpro.com/): Complete Soot Cleanup Solutions

After assessing fire and soot damage, SERVPRO follows a detailed, step-by-step plan to restore affected properties. Their approach combines advanced tools and proven techniques to handle even the toughest soot contamination. By addressing both visible damage and hidden issues, such as air quality and structural concerns, SERVPRO ensures a thorough restoration process.

> "Your home likely suffers from fire and smoke damage and extensive water damage from firefighting efforts. SERVPRO® has the specialized fire restoration training needed to restore your home to pre-fire condition." – SERVPRO

### Step-by-Step Restoration Process

SERVPRO’s [Fire Damage Restoration Guide](/fire-damage-restoration-guide/) includes seven stages, starting with emergency contact and an in-depth inspection to assess the extent of the damage. Damage is classified into three categories – minor, medium, or major – based on severity. Their technicians pre-test surfaces to decide whether to restore or replace items and then apply tailored cleaning methods. During the water removal and drying stage, they simultaneously tackle damage caused by both fire and firefighting efforts.

The [Combating Smoke Odor Professional Techniques for a Fresh Home](/combating-smoke-odor-professional-techniques-for-a-fresh-home/) phase involves techniques customized to the type of residue. SERVPRO categorizes fire damage by severity: minor damage may only need light cleaning, moderate damage requires stronger deodorization, and major damage might involve addressing structural elements.

A notable example of their success comes from Mark H.’s business in Providence, RI. After a fire caused extensive soot damage, SERVPRO restored the building to a like-new state, with project manager Ray providing consistent support throughout the process.

### Professional Equipment

SERVPRO uses a range of cleaning methods, each suited to specific types of soot contamination:

| Cleaning Method | Application |
| --- | --- |
| Dry Cleaning | For light residues or as a pre-cleaning step |
| Wet Cleaning | For moderate to heavy residue removal |
| Spray and Wipe | For delicate items that can’t handle wet cleaning |
| Foam Cleaning | For upholstery fabrics prone to shrinking or bleeding |
| Abrasive Cleaning | For surfaces requiring agitation for deep cleaning |
| Immersion Cleaning | For items fully submerged in cleaning solutions |

To remove lingering smoke odors, SERVPRO employs odor elimination techniques such as fogging and industrial air scrubbers. The equipment and methods are carefully chosen based on the size and scope of the damage.

This tailored approach reflects SERVPRO’s commitment to their "restore versus replace" philosophy, helping property owners save money while preserving irreplaceable items. Considering that the average cost of a structure fire was $25,545 in 2019 and cooking fires in residential buildings resulted in $463 million in property losses from 2014 to 2016, this approach can make a significant financial difference.

> "SERVPRO specializes in restoring contents damaged by water, fire, or mold. Our expertise and ‘restore’ versus ‘replace’ mentality can help you save money while preserving precious keepsakes that can’t be replaced." – SERVPRO

Beyond structural restoration, SERVPRO also offers content restoration, electronic cleanup, and document drying, delivering a comprehensive fire damage recovery service.

## [ServiceMaster Restore](https://servicemasterrestorationct.com/): Professional Soot Cleaning

ServiceMaster Restore provides a thorough soot cleaning and fire recovery service designed to handle even the toughest post-fire challenges. Using specialized tools like HEPA vacuums and chemical sponges, their technicians safely remove soot from surfaces without spreading it or causing additional harm. Unlike standard cleaning products, which can smear soot and release harmful particles into the air, their equipment ensures effective removal without worsening the situation.

Their service doesn’t stop at cleaning. The team also addresses structural repairs, content cleaning, and odor elimination. They systematically clear damaged areas, removing debris and inspecting structural elements like framing and subfloors to ensure safety.

### 24/7 Emergency Service

ServiceMaster Restore operates around the clock, with local teams ready to respond within the critical first 24–48 hours after a fire . Their emergency services include board-up and site security to protect the property while restoration plans are developed. They also work directly with insurance companies to speed up claims, helping property owners recover more quickly.

One example of their quick response came in May 2020, when they handled an electrical fire at a 97-year-old homeowner’s residence in Fairfield County. The fire caused severe smoke damage and destroyed a bedroom, leaving the home uninhabitable. A ServiceMaster representative arrived the next day, and their team began work immediately. In just five working days, they completed the restoration, keeping the homeowner informed throughout the process.

### Structural Damage Evaluation

Every restoration begins with a detailed assessment of the fire damage. ServiceMaster Restore’s experts evaluate structural issues and identify the best cleaning techniques for the job. This includes determining the fire’s origin and assessing water damage caused by firefighting efforts. Based on their findings, they create a tailored restoration plan to meet the property’s specific needs. To prevent further damage, they implement protective measures like boarding up broken windows, securing walls, and tarping damaged roofs. This detailed evaluation lays the groundwork for their odor and soot removal strategies, ensuring no aspect of the damage is overlooked.

### Odor and Soot Removal

Smoke odors can linger long after visible damage is repaired, but ServiceMaster Restore tackles this with advanced techniques. Their process combines thermal fogging, ozone treatments, and hydroxyl technology to neutralize odors at the molecular level. HEPA air scrubbers are also used to remove airborne particles, ensuring a clean and neutral environment. After addressing odors, they perform specialized dry cleaning for fabrics and other contents.

Their comprehensive fire restoration process includes identifying the fire’s source, addressing water damage, evaluating sensitive materials, removing damaged contents, performing structural repairs, and cleaning and deodorizing surfaces. ServiceMaster strongly advises against DIY cleaning, as improper methods can worsen the damage and spread contamination. Their trained technicians ensure the job is done correctly and safely.
