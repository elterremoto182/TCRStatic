As a homeowner, you are always trying to safeguard your valuables and property. Water damage can take many forms, such as the emergence of water stains on furniture or floors if left unchecked for some time due to even small leaks. It is thus essential that every measure be taken immediately in order to prevent any severe damages from occurring.

A leak in the roof can [Tell Mold Behind Walls](/tell-mold-behind-walls/). Flood water from outside can bring bacteria into the home. All of these are water damage, but they require different approaches to fix them.

Are you unsure when a full-scale water damage restoration is necessary, or if it’s enough to allow things to simply dry out? Here’s your guide on how to differentiate between the two scenarios.

## **The Signs**

In general, a good rule of thumb when it comes to water damage restoration is if you wouldn’t drink the water that is causing the damage, then you want to bring on professionals. There’s a big difference between water coming from a sink in your home and black water from a flood.

In some cases, you need specialized equipment to even be in the house, let alone do any kind of work. If you can pinpoint exactly where the water came from and know that it’s no threat to you, you may be able to move some valuables around and do a little bit of drying work yourself.

However, this only applies to the smallest of spills. If you’re not sure where the water is coming from, always get help from someone who does water damage restoration. This is partly so you can stay safe, and partly so the problem gets fixed completely.

Just cleaning up the water stain isn’t enough. You need to find and fix the cause of the leak, as well as repair any damage that has already been done.

## Common Causes Of Water Damage

Water damage can be caused by a wide variety of sources, from natural disasters to plumbing issues. One of the most common causes of water damage is flooding, which can be caused by heavy rains, overflowing rivers, or other natural disasters. Other common sources of water damage include broken pipes, leaky roofs, faulty appliances, and overflowing toilets.

In addition, water can seep into basements and crawl spaces if there is inadequate waterproofing or poor drainage. Water damage can also occur due to inadequate maintenance of a home’s plumbing system, such as failing to replace worn-out pipes or not properly maintaining water heaters.

For example in Florida a common cause is [Cast Iron Pipes](/cast-iron-pipes/). This is due to old construction methods that are not being used anymore.

Finally, faulty construction can also lead to water damage, as poorly sealed windows and doors can allow water to seep into a home.

## **The Next Step**

After you’ve decided that water damage restoration is what you are looking for, the first thing you should do, even before looking for a provider, is take a look at your insurance policy.

Different home insurance policies provide causes for water damage from different sources. For example, if there was a sudden pipe failure, your restoration may be covered by insurance. However, something like a flood would require separate flood insurance. Taking this extra step will give you a better idea of the true cost of your water damage restoration.

After this, you can start looking for a provider. Note that when it comes to making a final decision, there are three main things to look out for:

-   Professional certification
-   A strong background of past clients
-   Experience dealing with your type of water damage.
