## Main Steps in Fire Damage Inspections

(/services/air-quality-inspections/) involve a careful process to assess a building’s safety and outline the repairs needed. Following a structured approach ensures inspections align with safety standards and provide a clear path for restoration. Here’s a breakdown of the main steps involved.

### Safety Checks Before Starting

Safety is the first priority before entering a fire-damaged site. Inspectors must get clearance from local authorities, turn off utilities, and bring in battery-powered lighting. Wearing proper personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential – this includes fire-resistant clothing, hard hats, safety glasses, heavy-duty gloves, N95 respirators, and steel-toed boots. Emergency exit routes should also be established to reduce risks.

Ventilation is another key step to avoid exposure to harmful substances like carbon monoxide, asbestos, and volatile organic compounds. When dealing with wet or damp materials, masks and gloves are necessary to protect against mold and water-related hazards. Once these precautions are in place, inspectors can move forward to assess the building’s structural soundness.

### Checking Building Structure

Examining the structural integrity of the building is a crucial step in fire damage inspections. After clearing debris, structural engineers assess the main components to determine safety and prioritize repairs. This initial evaluation looks at the extent of the damage, whether repairs are feasible, and if further tests are needed.

Key indicators like cracks, spalling, deflections, distortions, misalignment, and exposed steel reinforcements are documented. The fire’s intensity and duration are also considered, as high heat can cause concrete to spall, wood to char, and steel to warp. Cracks wider than 1/16 inch are measured, and both destructive and non-destructive testing methods are used to verify findings. Once the structure has been assessed, attention shifts to the building’s critical systems.

### Inspecting Electrical, HVAC, and Plumbing Systems

Fire damage often impacts more than just the visible structure; it can also compromise essential systems like electrical, HVAC, and plumbing. Inspectors check wiring and outlets for heat damage and ensure that wall and ceiling penetrations maintain fire containment. HVAC systems are examined for hidden damage, soot, (/combating-smoke-odor-professional-techniques-for-a-fresh-home/), or melted components, while plumbing systems are inspected for leaks, corrosion, and proper functionality. This includes evaluating gas lines for cracks or corrosion and checking fixtures such as sinks, toilets, and showers.

Bringing in experienced professionals for these inspections ensures that all systems are thoroughly reviewed and meet safety requirements before the building is deemed ready for use.

## Rules and Compliance Requirements

Fire damage inspections must adhere to specific regulations and local codes. Familiarity with these rules ensures inspections meet legal standards and that restoration efforts are approved without unnecessary delays.

### (https://www.nfpa.org/en) Rules and Requirements

The **NFPA 25** standard sets the baseline for inspecting, testing, and maintaining water-based fire protection systems, including sprinklers, standpipes, fire pumps, and water storage systems. These guidelines aim to protect lives and property by establishing strict schedules for Inspection, Testing, and Maintenance (ITM) tasks, which must be carried out by qualified professionals.

Compliance with NFPA standards significantly improves (/home-safety-tips-preventing-electrical-fires/) outcomes. For example, the likelihood of dying in a fire decreases by 90% when sprinkler systems are operational, and property damage is reduced by as much as two-thirds, depending on the type of occupancy. However, 79% of sprinkler failures stem from preventable issues like accidental shutoffs, damage, or poor maintenance. To stay effective, NFPA standards are regularly updated to incorporate technological advancements, industry trends, and lessons from real-world incidents. Building owners and managers are encouraged to follow these regulations to avoid penalties and ensure safety.

These NFPA guidelines provide the foundation for the advanced practices discussed in the next section.

### (https://iicrc.org/) Professional Standards

In addition to NFPA standards, the **IICRC** offers specialized protocols for (/fire-damage-restoration-a-step-by-step-guide/). The **ANSI/IICRC S700 Standard**, introduced in January 2025, outlines modern procedures for assessing fire damage, contractor qualifications, documentation, and compliance with Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJ).

> "Providing a Standard of Care for the (/miramar-restoration-services/) of structural fire and (/smoke-damage-long-term-effects-and-restoration-techniques/) to the restoration community is a massive win for our industry."
> 
> -   Brandon Burton, IICRC Standards Chairman

Drawing on over 60 years of restoration experience and countless successful projects, the S700 standard provides comprehensive guidance on key areas like damage assessment, equipment use, mitigation strategies, odor management, (/services/indoor-air-quality), and post-restoration evaluations. These standards clearly define expectations for professional restorers, using terms like "should" and "shall" to set boundaries for competency. With over 60,000 certified technicians and 6,000 Certified Firms across 22 countries, the IICRC standards are widely respected within the industry.

### Local Building Code Rules

Local building codes complement national standards by addressing specific inspection and restoration requirements. These codes ensure structures meet both local and national fire safety regulations \. For example, fire alarm and system requirements are enforced at the municipal level, and some flexibility is allowed during emergencies. In California, building codes are updated every three years in alignment with the (https://www.iccsafe.org/) (IBC). During emergencies, executive orders like **California’s N-4-25** may temporarily ease regulations to speed up rebuilding efforts.

However, local authorities may restrict reconstruction if it poses risks to public health or safety. Non-compliance with fire alarm codes can result in severe legal and financial consequences. Property owners and managers must act promptly to address violations identified by agencies like the (https://lafd.org/) (LAFD) to avoid penalties and ensure compliance.

## How to Document and Report Inspections

Accurate documentation is crucial for planning restoration efforts and supporting insurance claims. By thoroughly recording all fire damage, you create a solid foundation for the recovery process. Here’s how to approach it.

### Taking Photos and Videos

Visual records are essential for capturing the full scope of fire damage. Use high-resolution cameras to take photos and videos from multiple angles, ensuring each file is timestamped. Wide shots help show overall damage, while close-ups highlight specific issues like charred surfaces or smoke stains. Make sure to document every affected area.

In February 2025, (https://www.firecashbuyer.com/) suggested homeowners organize their visual documentation by creating separate folders for each room or area. They recommended using clear, consistent naming systems and storing backups in cloud services, with additional copies on external hard drives. This method not only keeps records safe but also simplifies sharing them with insurance representatives, speeding up the claims process.

Add brief descriptions to each image and note the time it was taken. If possible, collect samples of damaged materials – particularly when the damage might not be fully visible in the photos.

### Writing Reports for Insurance Claims

A detailed written report is another vital piece of the documentation process. Create a list of damaged items, including descriptions, quantities, estimated values, and original purchase details. Include any fire-related expenses, such as temporary housing, emergency repairs, or additional living costs. Keeping track of these costs and communications with insurance adjusters, contractors, or (/the-future-of-restoration-innovations-in-water-fire-and-mold-remediation/) ensures there’s a clear record of all agreements and discussions.

Be specific about the size of affected areas and the materials involved. If you’ve consulted professionals, include their assessments and recommendations. These technical inputs often carry weight with insurance companies when determining settlement amounts. Additionally, update the report if new issues arise or conditions change.

### Using Technology for Better Documentation

While traditional methods are important, modern technology can take documentation to the next level. Tools like thermal imaging, drones, 3D mapping, photogrammetry, and LiDAR help uncover hidden damage and create detailed structural models. Cloud-based reporting systems and specialized software also improve accuracy and compliance.

For example, during the 2018 Camp Fire in California, drones provided real-time imagery and thermal data, helping emergency responders prioritize their actions. Similarly, during Australia’s 2019–2020 "Black Summer" bushfires, drones and satellite imagery were critical for assessing damage, evaluating wildlife habitat loss, and planning reforestation efforts.

Technologies like 3D mapping and LiDAR offer precise models of burned areas, which are invaluable for structural analysis and reconstruction planning. With over 1,388,500 fire incidents reported in the United States in 2020, according to the NFPA, these tools are becoming indispensable for managing the growing complexity of fire damage documentation.
