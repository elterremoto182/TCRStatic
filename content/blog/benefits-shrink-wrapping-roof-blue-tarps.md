## Blue Tarps

The most common tarp which, is the blue tarp. This is usually the cheapest tarp and least durable. We typically recommend these as emergency tarps for short periods of time.

For example, if you’re waiting for the insurance adjuster or a roofer to come out and inspect the roof. They can last for a few weeks or a couple of months depending on the weather. Some of them are not even waterproof.

## **Intro To Shrink Wrapping** 

There are a variety of reasons why you may feel like you need to go that extra mile to keep your roof safe, especially in South Florida, where weather can pose a potential hazard.

Perhaps hurricane season is coming and you just want that added layer of security for your home.

Perhaps your roof is being restored and you want to protect the work while it is being done. Or, in the worst case scenario, your roof is already damaged and you need a temporary hold-over while waiting for repairs.

A lot of people in this situation simply use a [Roof Tarping](/services/roof-tarping/) to cover their roof, but you have other options.

Here’s how shrink wrapping a roof works and why it may be your ideal choice.

## **Why Do I Need To Shrink Wrap?**

Shrink-wrapping a roof is basically what you would expect, using a tough yet light shrink wrap installed around a roof in order to serve as a layer of protection for roofs that are either already damaged or at risk of damage from weather or other problems.

A shrink wrap is not only important to avoid roof damage, but also to stop damage to your home.

The main reason you should consider a shrink wrap is to avoid water damage to your home. The longer you let water into your home, the more damage it can create.

This damage can lead to a very expensive water damage restoration. If you find water damage in your house you should read our [Water Damage Restoration Guide](/water-damage-restoration-guide/).

In addition, if you are in the South Florida area reach out to us for a free inspection.

## **Which Shrink Wrap Should I Get?** 

There are a variety of different materials and brands of shrink-wrap out there, even among those designed for roofing.

Ideally, you’re going to want to get a recommendation from our restoration experts in Miami to see what brand works best for you.

Shrink-wrapped roofs are generally a series of shrink-wrapped sheets held together with a combination of clips, patch tape, and a propane gas hot air gun.

This gun is the key item here, as it is used to create “welds” between the different shrink-wrapped sheets, which leads to the actual tightening of the sheets.

## **Should I Try To Shrink Wrap A Roof?**

Note that this isn’t the type of work that you want to try and do yourself. On top of the inherent danger of working on a roof, a proper shrink wrap roof installation will generally require scaffolding, especially for a new roof. Even with these steps, it can still be quicker to do certain shrink wrapping installations than using something like a blue tarp.

So, with all these added precautions, why go to the trouble of shrink wrapping your roof? One of the major benefits is that when it comes to using a blue tarp over a roof, you basically have to hope your roof is a good fit in order to get proper coverage.

Because of the nature of shrink-wrapping, it’s a lot easier to try and get something that fits tightly around oddly-shaped roofs, which can be essential if you have an older or custom-made home. This perfect seal/shrink wrap is going to be what keeps out rain, [Mold Remediation](/services/mold-remediation/), and other undesirable things until your roof can be repaired.

This is essential when it comes to heavy storm or wind conditions, as contractors don’t have to worry about returning to different parts of the shrink wrapping to reattach things due to damage.

## Wraps Look Much Better 

If you’re working as a contractor, this also makes for a more appealing look.

This may seem like an odd trait to bring up for something like roof repair or restoration, but there are plenty of reasons that you may need a smart appearance.

For example, you may be working on a more public or high-profile project where keeping a good appearance is paramount. Shrink-wrap sheeting is far better than blue tarp at helping keep up these kinds of appearances.

There are some added bonuses as well, depending on your plans. For example, as part of your restoration process, you may need to do work inside the home before the roof is worked on.

Unlike your conventional blue tarp, there are a lot of shrink wraps out there that allow for the transmission of natural light. 

## Cost of Shrink Wraps

Shrink wraps are more expensive due to the cost of:

-   Materials
-   Installation Takes Longer
-   Installation Requires Special Equipment

Shrink wraps are great but they may be cost prohibitive for many clients.

The cost of shrink wrapping a roof can vary depending on several factors such as the size and complexity of the roof, the type of shrink wrap material used, and the location of the project.

The cost of materials for shrink wrapping a roof can range from $0.10 to $1.50 per square foot, depending on the thickness and quality of the shrink wrap material.

Labor costs can also vary, but on average it can cost between $1 and $3 per square foot for the installation of shrink wrap.

Overall, the total cost of shrink wrapping a roof can range from $1 to $4 per square foot. It is important to consider that these costs are just estimates and may vary based on the specific project.

## Grey Tarps Are A Great Option

The option we recommend the most at Total Care Restoration is the grey tarp. We custom ordered these tarps for our customers. The reason we installed this tarp more than the other two is because you get a great price and the durability of a shrink wrap.

These tarps are thicker than blue tarps, waterproof and UV light protected. The sun is one of the things that damages tarps the most. UV light protection makes sure tarps last much longer.
