-   Unusual buzzing sounds

Homes built between 1965 and 1973 often contain aluminum wiring, which is particularly hazardous. In fact, homes with aluminum wiring are **55 times more likely** to experience conditions leading to a fire compared to homes with copper wiring.

### Circuit Overload Issues

Electrical systems can become dangerous when circuits are overloaded – meaning they’re handling more power than they’re designed to manage.

Signs of an overloaded circuit include:

-   Buzzing noises around outlets
-   Circuit breakers tripping frequently

To address this risk, the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/) (CPSC) recommends installing **Arc Fault Circuit Interrupters (AFCIs)**, which could prevent over half of electrical fires.

### Defective Appliances and Wiring

Faulty appliances also play a significant role in electrical fire hazards. Defective or malfunctioning appliances can spark fires, contributing to serious losses. In 2021 alone, electrical fires in residential buildings caused **295 deaths**, **900 injuries**, and more than **$1.2 billion** in property damage.

> If an appliance starts malfunctioning, stop using it immediately.

Signs that an appliance might be failing include:

-   Wobbling or shaking during operation
-   Reduced performance or efficiency
-   Strange odors while running
-   Unusual noises
-   Inconsistent temperatures

Clothes dryers are a common culprit. From 2018 to 2020, **failure to clean** was the leading cause of dryer fires, accounting for 31% of incidents. Keeping appliances in good working condition is essential for fire prevention.

## Electrical System Safety Steps

Keeping your electrical system in check is crucial for avoiding fires and ensuring safety. A combination of video inspection and routine homeowner checks can help maintain a safe environment for everyone.

## Safe Appliance Operation

Taking care of how you use your appliances is just as important as regular inspections when it comes to reducing fire risks. Electrical appliances, if not operated properly, can pose serious hazards. According to the Electrical Safety Foundation International, electrical malfunctions are behind about 47,700 home fires each year, leading to 418 deaths and causing $1.4 billion in property damage.

### Outlet Load Management

Understanding your home’s electrical capacity is key to avoiding overloaded circuits. Here’s how to manage it safely:

-   **Know your circuit’s capacity:** Most household circuits are rated for either 15 or 20 amps.
-   **Calculate the safe load:** Multiply the circuit’s amperage by 120 volts. For instance, a 15-amp circuit supports up to 1,800 watts (15 amps × 120V).
-   **Stay within limits:** To reduce the risk of overloading, aim to use only about 80% of the circuit’s maximum capacity.

| Circuit Rating | Maximum Safe Load | Example Devices |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 15 amps | 1,440 watts | Computers, TVs, small appliances |
| 20 amps | 1,920 watts | Microwaves, window AC units |

### Extension Cord Safety

Extension cords are convenient but can be dangerous if misused. In fact, they account for around 3,300 home fires each year. Keep these safety tips in mind:

> "Extension cords can be very helpful in delivering power right where we need it. However, regardless of the gauge or rating of the cord, an extension cord is a temporary solution and is not meant to be used as a long-term extension of your household’s electrical system."  
> – Electrical Safety Foundation International

To use them safely:

-   Choose cords certified by [UL](https://www.ul.com/solutions), [Intertek](https://www.intertek.com/product-certification-marks/etl/), or (https://www.csagroup.org/?srsltid=AfmBOorUpCr7WD6rUa9klo0R0gN0mt0-g6RyNiMHJrCS0E6is-x98xq_).
-   Match the cord’s amperage rating to the appliance you’re powering.
-   Never run cords under rugs or through walls.
-   Replace cords that are damaged or frayed immediately.
-   Avoid connecting multiple cords together (daisy-chaining).

These precautions are especially important when dealing with high-demand appliances that require more power.

### High-Power Appliance Care

High-power appliances, like refrigerators and dryers, need extra attention to stay safe. They should always be on dedicated circuits and maintained regularly. Here’s how to ensure their safe operation:

Acting quickly and efficiently is key during an electrical fire. Here’s what to do:

-   **Turn off the power** by switching off the circuit breaker.
-   **For small fires**, use baking soda or a Class C fire extinguisher to put it out.
-   **If the fire is out of control**, evacuate immediately.

> "If you are unable to extinguish the electrical fire…GET OUT. You and any family members need to leave as soon as you can to prevent injury or loss of life. Do not try to be a hero."

Once you’ve safely evacuated or controlled the fire, follow your pre-planned escape route to protect your family.

### Home Exit Strategy

An effective escape plan is essential, and the National Fire Protection Association highlights these key components:

| **Planning Element** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Exit Routes** | Make sure every room has two exits, like a door and a window, and keep them clear. |
| **Meeting Point** | Decide on a visible spot outside for everyone to gather, making it easier for emergency responders to locate you. |
| **Special Needs** | Assign helpers to assist children, elderly family members, or anyone with mobility challenges. |
| **Practice** | Conduct fire drills regularly, both during the day and at night, to prepare for different scenarios. |

At night, keep bedroom doors closed to slow the spread of smoke and fire. Practice crawling low to avoid smoke while moving quickly toward exits.

### Fire Damage Recovery

Once everyone is safe and the evacuation is complete, the focus shifts to recovery. Professional restoration services are critical in this phase. (/), for example, offers 24/7 [Fire Damage Restoration](/fire-damage-restoration/) to help homeowners recover. Their services include:

-   Fast response to limit further damage.
