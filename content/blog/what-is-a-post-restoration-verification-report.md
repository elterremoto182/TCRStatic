## Step-by-Step Guide to the Verification Process

The verification process after restoration is carefully structured to ensure all restored areas meet safety and quality standards. By understanding each stage, property owners can better anticipate what happens during this essential phase.

### Visual Inspection and Documentation

The first step is a detailed visual inspection to confirm the restoration work has been completed as intended.

This step ensures that the visible aspects of remediation align with established standards.

It serves as proof that the property has been properly restored and is safe for occupancy. Additionally, this documentation is invaluable for property records and can be useful for future transactions or inspections.
