## What is Mold Sanitization?

Mold sanitization is the process of removing mold growth from a property and reducing the number of spores in the air. Sanitization is usually done through the use of chemical agents that kill the existing mold spores and prevent new spores from growing.

This process is not intended to remove the source of the mold, but rather to reduce the amount of mold spores that are present in an area.

## What is Mold Remediation?

[Mold Remediation](/services/mold-remediation/) is the process of removing the source of the mold growth and restoring the area to a safe and healthy condition. This usually involves the removal of any materials that are contaminated by mold, such as [Tell Mold Behind Walls](/tell-mold-behind-walls/), insulation, and carpets. After the removal, the affected area is then treated with an anti-fungal agent to prevent further mold growth.

## What causes mold in a home?

Mold growth in a home is often caused by excess moisture and humidity. Common sources of moisture in a home include leaks and condensation buildup. Poor ventilation and inadequate insulation can also lead to mold growth.

Additionally, certain cleaning and household products can cause mold to grow if they are not cleaned up properly.

## How Do Mold Sanitization and Remediation Differ?

The main difference between mold sanitization and remediation is the goal of each process. Mold sanitization is intended to reduce the number of mold spores in an area, while mold remediation is intended to remove the source of the mold growth.

Mold sanitization is a short-term solution that can be used to reduce the presence of mold spores, while mold remediation is a more long-term solution that can help to restore the area to a healthy condition.

## Sanitization vs Restoration Costs

The cost of mold sanitization will depend on the size and severity of the mold problem, as well as the type of chemical agents used. Generally speaking, mold sanitization is less expensive than mold remediation as it does not involve the removal of materials.

On the other hand, mold remediation can be expensive as it involves the removal of materials that are contaminated with mold, as well as the use of anti-fungal agents. Ultimately, the cost of each process will depend on the extent of the mold problem and the type of remediation needed.

How long does it take?

Mold sanitization usually takes a few hours to complete, while mold remediation can take several days or even weeks depending on the size and severity of the mold problem.
