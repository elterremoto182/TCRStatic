If you would like to understand more how tarps work and how they protect your home, here is a video on the different types of roof tarps that exist.

## What types of tarps should I use?

We currently use grey tarps with UV protection. These tarps will protect your roof longer. They resist sun damage much better than regular blue tarps. Also they are thicker and can withstand stronger winds.

## Hurricane Ian Water Damage

There are many types of water damage caused by large storms like hurricane Ian:

-   Flood Damage
-   Wind Caused Water Damage

Wind caused water damage can be covered by your home owners insurance.

However, most insurance companies do not cover flood caused water damage. But don’t worry as we have helped many clients clean up their flood damaged homes.

Here is an idea what our water damage clean up process looks like:

## Water Damage Complete Process

What Happens During The Water Damage Process?

Technicians use a variety of sensors and meters to accurately measure and display the moisture content of floors, walls, ceilings, and other materials. This helps them determine the best way to dry these materials out or if they need to be torn out.

Using a fan to blow air across a surface causes the water to evaporate, while a [Restoration Dehumidifiers](/restoration-dehumidifiers/) then extracts the moisture from the air and drains it away to prevent any further damage.

Deodorization Equipment

The following is equipment that is used for a dry out.

-   Air Scrubber: This machine removes chemicals, particles, and/or gasses from the air.
-   Foggers: These machines eliminate odors by transforming chemicals into a fog.
-   Thermal Foggers: These machines heat a solvent-based deodorizer that is turned into a dry smoke/fog, which is then blown into a room.

## After The Job Is Done

1\. Sanitation and Cleaning

Once the restoration company removes the moisture and dries the area, they can then perform a final cleaning to sanitize and prevent bacteria growth. This final step also eliminates any odors caused by the water damage.

2\. Mold Growth

Mold growth is a common occurrence in moist environments that are created after water damage. To avoid this, it is necessary to properly dry an area and then sanitize it. Although it is not always possible to completely prevent mold, a reputable restoration company can remove any mold that appears and inform the home or business owner about the potential for future mold growth.

3\. Reconstruction

In the event that water damage has caused significant destruction to flooring, walls, or ceilings, it may be necessary to repair or replace them. The restoration company may handle minor repairs, but they may also refer you to a subcontractor to complete any larger reconstruction jobs.

4\. Inspection

At the conclusion of the restoration process, a walk-through typically takes place with the home or business owner, the insurance adjustor or agent, and the technicians. This helps to ensure that all work has been completed to the expected standards and is satisfactory.
