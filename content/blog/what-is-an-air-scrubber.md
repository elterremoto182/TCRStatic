Air scrubbers are air purifiers that work to reduce levels of indoor air pollutants and allergens. They are designed to remove airborne contaminants such as:

-   Dust
-   Pollen
-   Dander
-   Mold
-   Smoke
-   Hair
-   Odors

They remove these from the air in your home or business.

Air scrubbers are becoming increasingly popular in homes and businesses as people become more aware of the potential health risks associated with poor indoor air quality. These air purifiers are designed to help improve air quality and protect the health of those who live and work in the space.

Air scrubbers work by using a combination of air filters, fans, and other components to capture airborne particles and contaminants. They are designed to capture particles as small as 0.3 microns, which is about the size of smoke particles. The air is then circulated through a series of filters, which trap the particles and contaminants.

Air scrubbers are available in a variety of sizes, designs, and configurations. Some models are equipped with additional features, such as ultraviolet (UV) lights, to further reduce the levels of indoor air pollutants and allergens.

## Benefits of Using an Air scrubber

Air scrubbers are designed to reduce levels of indoor air pollutants and allergens and improve air quality in homes and businesses. They can help to reduce the levels of dust, dander, smoke, and odors in the air. This can help to reduce the risk of respiratory illnesses and other health problems associated with poor air quality.

Air scrubbers can also help to reduce the levels of allergens in the air. This can help to reduce the symptoms of allergies and asthma in those who suffer from these conditions.

In addition, air scrubbers can help to improve the efficiency of heating and cooling systems. This can help to reduce energy costs and make the home or business more comfortable.

Restoration and Air Scrubbers

  
Air scrubbers are commonly used in [Water Restoration](/services/water-restoration/) and [Mold Remediation](/services/mold-remediation/). They help reduce levels of mold and other airborne contaminants that could be present in a home or business after a water damage event.

Air scrubbers also help to reduce levels of mold and other microorganisms in the air. This can help to reduce the risk of mold-related health problems and reduce the need for costly mold remediation.

Finally, airscrubbers can help to reduce the levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air. VOCs are chemicals found in many household products, such as paint, cleaning supplies, and adhesives. High levels of VOCs can cause health problems, such as headaches and nausea.

## Tips for Choosing an Air scrubber

When choosing an airscrubber, it is important to consider the size of the space that needs to be treated. Airscrubbers are available in a variety of sizes, so it is important to choose one that is the right size for the space.

It is also important to consider the type of air filter that is used in the air scrubber. Some air scrubbers use HEPA filters, which are designed to capture particles as small as 0.3 microns. Others use carbon filters, which are designed to capture odors and VOCs.

It is also important to consider the additional features offered by the air scrubber. Some models are equipped with additional features, such as ultraviolet (UV) lights, to further reduce the levels of indoor air pollutants and allergens.

## Conclusion

Air scrubbers are air purifiers that are designed to reduce levels of indoor air pollutants and allergens. They are becoming increasingly popular in homes and businesses as people become more aware of the potential health risks associated with poor indoor air quality. Air scrubbers can help to reduce levels of dust, dander, smoke, and odors in the air, as well as allergens and VOCs.

They can also help to improve the efficiency of heating and cooling systems and reduce energy costs. When choosing an air scrubber, it is important to consider the size of the space that needs to be treated, the type of air filter that is used, and the additional features offered by the air scrubber.
