## **The Basics of Water Damage Restoration**

Dealing with water damage in a home or business can be confusing and frustrating; the water damage restoration process is just a pain! Water causes a lot of damage and makes a huge mess that can turn into a major headache.  It may seem like all hope is lost and the house or office will have to be gutted, but that’s often far from the truth. Water damage comes in various shapes and forms, from small leaks to all-out flooding. They all have the potential to be remediated, but understanding the categories of water damage is important. It’s also important to know that water damage is broken down into classes depending on the methods it will take to fix the problem.

## **Causes of Water Damage**

Water damage can occur at any time and anywhere. It doesn’t discriminate and will more than likely happen when the homeowner least expects it. Some of the most common causes of water damage in Miami include the following:

-   Broken pipes
-   Backed up drains or toilets
-   Flooding

If any of these common water damage occurrences happen, you may need to call a professional to help remediate the situation. They have the expertise, experience, and equipment to ensure that the process is done right, with minimal health risks to the occupants of the home or office building. 

## **Water Damage Restoration Equipment**

There are some common and expected types of equipment carried by water restoration technicians. They often include detection equipment, air moving equipment, deodorization equipment, and generators. They each have a specific purpose and are used to get your house or office dry and back to pre-damaged condition.

### **Detection Equipment: Moisture Sensors and Meters**

These are used by technicians to discover how wet an area is so they know exactly what will need to be done to remediate the situation. These sensors and meters display the moisture content of floors, ceilings, walls, and other materials so a plan can be developed to get them dry or tear them out—whichever is needed most for the situation. 

### **Air Moving Equipment: Fans and Dehumidifiers**

Getting an area dry requires removing the moisture not only from the affected materials but also from the air. Fans will blow air across the surface and cause the water to evaporate, then the dehumidifiers will draw it out of the air and drain it so that it won’t settle back into the material and cause further damage to the room. 

### **Deodorization Equipment**

**Air Scrubber:** This machine works by removing chemicals, particles, and/or gasses from the air. It draws in air from the surrounding space and pushes it through various filters to remove the contaminants that contribute to odor.

**Foggers:** These machines turn a chemical into a fog to eliminate odors from a room. They can also be used to kill bacteria or as a way to reduce or discourage (/tell-mold-behind-walls/) has occurred.

**Thermal Foggers:** These machines work by using a solvent-based deodorizer that is heated and turned into a dry smoke/fog, which is blown into a room. The vaporized cleaning solution clings to the odor molecules and absorbs them, ridding the area of the smell. When combined with cleaning, this is an effective deodorizing technique.

**Generators:** In the case of water damages that cause the loss of power, it’s important for the technicians to have a power supply. They generally have generators so that the equipment can be used properly to repair the damage. 

## **What to Expect Before and After a Water Damage Restoration Cleanup Process**

No two water restoration jobs are the same. They are each unique and require different techniques and cleanup methods. It’s possible to clean water damage yourself, but there could be deeper issues that you are unaware that a professional would be better able to handle.

Finding a professional Miami restoration company that will work with you is important, and there’s a process to ensure you find one that will restore your property to pre-damage condition.

### **How do you choose a reputable restoration company?**

Having your home damaged by water is an incredibly stressful and emotional experience. Getting it back to a pre-disaster condition is important, and finding a restoration company that can do that is a top priority. But how do you choose a reputable restoration company?

1.  **Look Locally**  
    Finding a company that works locally in the Miami area will mean that they’ll be able to get to your house or business as soon as possible to assess the damage and get started on the restoration process.

2.  **Check Credentials**  
    Restoring a home or office after water damage is accomplished by following industry standards. A good company will send their technicians to training to get them certified. The business itself should also be certified. When looking for a restoration professional, look for one that has been (https://www.iicrc.org/) and has the skill and expertise to deal with water damage in ways that are nationally recognized and approved. This will also ensure that the technicians are trained in the proper use of all water restoration equipment and can employ advanced water restoration methodologies. Since no two water restoration jobs are the same, you need someone who can think on their feet and complete the job satisfactorily and within industry standards.

3.  **Works with Insurance**  
    When a major disaster like water damage strikes, the (https://howmuch.net/costs/home-water-damage-repair-restore). Very few people will be able to pay for the damage out of their pocket, so they’ll rely on their insurance to help cover the bill. A good restoration company will work with insurance to get your home or office back together. If they don’t, you need to keep looking. In addition, you may also consider contacting your insurance agent to see if they have a restoration company that they recommend. This will ensure that you are getting a reputable company that you know will work with your insurance to get the job completed.

4.  **Check References**  
    It’s easier than ever to check reviews and references online. Finding these for a restoration company shouldn’t be difficult. While no company will ever have all positive reviews, make sure the company you’re looking to hire has more positive than negative reviews. 

## **Water Damage Restoration Timeline**

1.  **Inspection**  
    The first step in the restoration process is knowing exactly what has been damaged and what needs to be fixed. This is when they will use their moisture sensors and meters to see how far the damage goes and how wet the area is, including the ceiling, walls, and carpet/carpet pad or other flooring. It will also be determined whether or not the electricity is in jeopardy or has been shorted out by the water. Turning power sources off at the electrical box may or may not occur depending on the extent of the damage. During this time, it’s important to talk with the technician and find out exactly what needs to be done to correct the water damage issues. There may be tear-out that will occur, and it’s important to know beforehand who will be doing repairs at the completion of the job.

2.  **Remove Standing Water**  
    If there is standing water in the area, this will be removed. No other work will be able to continue if the water remains in the area. This will also allow the technicians to find the source of the issue (if it’s coming from a broken pipe or backed up drain) so that the issue can be taken care of.

3.  **Prevent Further Damage**  
    Taking care of water damage needs to be done in a timely fashion. If it sits for too long, there’s a chance that (https://www.angieslist.com/articles/how-fast-can-water-damage-ruin-home.htm) or a Category 1 water damage will turn into a Category 2, which can have impacts on your health. This step may include calling a plumber (if one hasn’t already been called) to discover and stop any leaks. It may also require the removal of affected flooring, walls, and ceiling. Water damage can weaken the integrity of certain structural materials, making them a hazard if they collapse. In some cases, this material may not be able to dry properly, so to prevent water remaining trapped in the area, it will be removed.

4.  **Drying**  
    After the standing water has been removed and materials that could pose a drying or structural hazard have been removed, (/water-damage-dry-out-process/) will begin. This often involves placing fans and a dehumidifier in the area. In some cases, it might also involve putting up plastic sheeting and using heaters so that the water can evaporate. If walls have been impacted, it may be necessary to remove baseboards or drill holes so that they dry properly. A section of the carpet may also have to be lifted so that the carpet and the pad will dry. If these processes aren’t conducted, the chance of odor and mold growth increases. There’s also a chance of structural damage happening from excessive moisture.

5.  **Monitoring**  
    Throughout the entire process, the technicians will monitor how well the drying is going. They’ll use their meters to test the moisture content in the affected areas and ensure that their equipment is working properly. Depending on the severity of the damage, this process may take from one day to several.

6.  **Completion**  
    Once the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the technician will remove the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this point, the water remediation process is considered to complete.

7.  **Repair Additional Damage**  
    As mentioned, sometimes ceilings, walls, or flooring have to be torn out, baseboards might be removed, or holes might be drilled into walls to ensure proper drying. The water restoration company may do these repairs themselves or they may subcontract the work to professionals they use for this type of job. They may also recommend contractors for the homeowner to contact. Owners may also be able to use their own contractors if they so choose. Having this conversation during the inspection phase of the process will let the homeowner or business owner know what to expect when this phase is finally reached.

After any type of water damage, the possibility of mold growth increases. Ensuring that the area was properly dried and then sanitized should reduce this likelihood.

### **Reconstruction**

If anything was torn out such as flooring, walls, or the ceiling, these will need to be repaired and/or replaced. The restoration company may have the expertise to take care of small jobs, but they may also recommend or have subcontractors that will complete reconstruction.

In some cases, the insurance will also pay the restoration company directly. Talking to your agent will let you know how this process will be handled. 

### **Should You Hire an Adjuster**

Deciding whether or not to hire an adjuster for your claim will depend on a variety of things, including if you’re actually going to file a claim and if the damage is covered by your insurance policy.
