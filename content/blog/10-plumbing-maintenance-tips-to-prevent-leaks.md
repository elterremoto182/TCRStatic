Plumbing leaks can cause extensive damage and lead to high repair costs, but they're often avoidable with simple, regular maintenance. By dedicating a little time each month to inspect and care for your plumbing system, you can catch small issues early and prevent expensive problems.

## Key Takeaways

- **Check for leaks regularly** – Inspect pipes, toilets, and appliances for water stains, rust, or damp spots
- **Test water pressure** – Keep it between 40–60 PSI to avoid stressing your pipes
- **Clean drains** – Use natural cleaners like baking soda and vinegar to prevent clogs
- **Maintain your water heater** – Flush the tank and test the pressure relief valve annually
- **Insulate exposed pipes** – Protect pipes in cold areas to prevent freezing
- **Replace old fixtures** – Swap out aging parts before they fail
- **Inspect caulk and seals** – Replace cracked or worn caulk around sinks, tubs, and showers
- **Do seasonal checks** – Inspect outdoor fixtures and test sump pumps seasonally
- **Maintain your sump pump** – Test it regularly to avoid basement flooding
- **Call a professional when needed** – For complex issues, rely on an expert

## 1. Check for Leaks Regularly

Spend 20 minutes each month checking your home's plumbing. Inspect visible pipes under sinks, around toilets, and in your basement. Look for water stains, mineral buildup, or rust on pipes and fittings.

**Quick toilet test:** Add food coloring to the tank. If color appears in the bowl within 10 minutes without flushing, you have a leak.

If you suspect a hidden leak but can't locate it, professional [leak detection services](/leak-detection/) can use advanced technology like thermal imaging and acoustic devices to find leaks behind walls, under floors, or in your foundation without invasive testing.

## 2. Test and Control Water Pressure

Excessive water pressure strains pipes and causes premature wear. Use a pressure gauge (available at hardware stores) to test your water pressure. It should be between 40–60 PSI. Anything above 80 PSI needs a pressure regulator.

## 3. Clean and Maintain Drains

Clogged drains cause water backups that stress your plumbing. Prevent clogs by:
- Removing debris from drain covers
- Never pouring grease down the sink
- Using mesh strainers to catch food scraps
- Flushing drains monthly with baking soda and vinegar

Proper drain venting is also essential for preventing clogs and ensuring efficient drainage. Learn more about [advanced venting solutions for plumbing drains](/exploring-advanced-venting-solutions-for-plumbing-drains-what-you-need-to-know/) to understand how your plumbing system works.

## 4. Inspect and Maintain Your Water Heater

Your water heater accounts for about 18% of home energy use. Annual maintenance tasks include:
- Testing the TPR (temperature and pressure relief) valve
- Checking the anode rod for wear
- Flushing sediment from the tank

## 5. Insulate Exposed Pipes

Pipes in basements, crawl spaces, attics, and exterior walls can freeze and burst. Use foam pipe sleeves or fiberglass wrap to insulate exposed pipes – it's a DIY-friendly weekend project.

## 6. Replace Old Fixtures and Parts

Watch for signs of wear: rust around faucet bases, stiff handles, cracks in porcelain, or discoloration on supply lines. Simple replacements like faucet aerators, toilet flappers, and showerheads can prevent bigger problems.

**Florida homeowners note:** If your home was built before 1975, you may have [cast iron pipes](/cast-iron-pipes/) that are prone to corrosion and failure. These aging drain lines require special attention and often need complete replacement rather than simple repairs.

## 7. Check and Replace Worn Seals and Caulk

Worn caulk around bathtubs, showers, and sinks lets water seep behind walls. Inspect seals for cracks, peeling, or discoloration. Replacing caulk is an easy DIY task that prevents costly water damage.

## 8. Do Seasonal Plumbing Maintenance

- **Spring:** Check outdoor faucets and hoses for freeze damage
- **Summer/Fall:** Clear gutters and downspouts
- **Before rainy season:** Test your sump pump

## 9. Maintain and Monitor Your Sump Pump

Your sump pump protects against basement flooding. Test it each spring by pouring water into the pit. Clean the pump annually and check the float switch twice a year.

## 10. Know When to Call a Professional

Call a plumber for:
- Persistent low water pressure
- Recurring drain clogs
- Main water line or sewer issues
- Water stains on walls or ceilings
- Sewage odors

If you can't find the source of a leak, consider professional [leak detection services](/leak-detection/) that use thermal imaging, video pipe inspection, and electronic detection equipment to locate hidden leaks accurately.
