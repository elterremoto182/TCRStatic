Living in South Florida means accepting that hurricane season is part of life. From June through November, the Atlantic basin becomes increasingly active, and the threat of devastating storms looms over Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties.

As South Florida's trusted restoration company, Total Care Restoration has responded to every major hurricane to impact our region. We've seen the worst water damage imaginable—and we've learned exactly what separates homeowners who recover quickly from those who face months of hardship.

This guide will help you prepare, respond, and recover.

## Understanding Hurricane Water Damage in South Florida

### The Three Types of Hurricane Water Damage

1. **Storm Surge Flooding**
   - Sea water pushed inland by hurricane winds
   - Most destructive in coastal areas like Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale Beach, and Boca Raton
   - Covered by flood insurance, NOT homeowner's insurance

2. **Wind-Driven Rain Intrusion**
   - Water entering through damaged roofs, windows, or walls
   - Often covered by homeowner's insurance
   - Can begin during the storm and continue for days

3. **Post-Storm Flooding**
   - Standing water from overwhelmed drainage systems
   - Can take days to recede
   - Often treated as flood damage for insurance purposes

### Why South Florida Is Particularly Vulnerable

Our region faces unique challenges:
- **Flat terrain** means water has nowhere to drain
- **High water table** prevents absorption
- **Aging infrastructure** in many neighborhoods
- **Coastal exposure** from both Atlantic Ocean and Gulf influences
- **Year-round humidity** accelerates mold growth after flooding

## Before Hurricane Season: Preparation Checklist

### Home Exterior Preparation

**Roof Inspection (Priority #1)**
- Have a professional inspect your roof in May
- Replace missing or damaged shingles
- Secure loose flashing and ridge caps
- Clean gutters and downspouts
- Consider impact-resistant roofing if replacement is needed

**Window and Door Protection**
- Install hurricane shutters or impact windows
- Check door seals and weatherstripping
- Reinforce garage doors (the most common failure point)
- Secure sliding glass doors with hurricane bars

**Yard and Drainage**
- Trim trees and remove dead branches
- Clear drainage swales and culverts
- Know where your property drains naturally
- Secure or store outdoor furniture

### Interior Preparation

**Protect Valuables**
- Move important documents to waterproof containers
- Store electronics in upper levels or elevated locations
- Create a digital backup of family photos and records
- Know what your homeowner's insurance covers vs. flood insurance

**Plumbing and Electrical**
- Know how to shut off your main water supply
- Know how to disconnect electrical at the main breaker
- Consider installing check valves to prevent sewage backup
- Have a battery-powered sump pump on hand

### Insurance Preparation

**Review Your Coverage**
- Homeowner's insurance typically covers wind damage
- Flood insurance (NFIP or private) covers rising water
- Most policies have a 30-day waiting period for flood insurance
- Document your home's contents with video and photos

**Know Your Deductibles**
- Hurricane deductibles are often 2-5% of your home's insured value
- On a $500,000 home, that's $10,000-$25,000 out of pocket
- Some policies have separate wind and flood deductibles

## During a Hurricane Warning (24-72 Hours Out)

### Final Home Preparations

- [ ] Install hurricane shutters or plywood
- [ ] Fill bathtubs with water (for flushing toilets if water is cut)
- [ ] Move furniture away from windows
- [ ] Elevate valuable items off the floor
- [ ] Turn refrigerator and freezer to coldest settings
- [ ] Charge all devices and backup batteries
- [ ] Fill vehicles with gas
- [ ] Secure all outdoor items

### Emergency Supply Checklist

Essential supplies for post-storm recovery:
- Water (1 gallon per person per day for 7 days)
- Non-perishable food
- Battery-powered radio
- Flashlights and extra batteries
- First aid kit
- Important documents in waterproof container
- Cash (ATMs may be down)
- Manual can opener
- Tarps and plastic sheeting
- Wet/dry vacuum if available

## During the Storm

### Safety First

- Stay away from windows and glass doors
- Take shelter in an interior room
- If flooding begins, move to higher ground—never try to walk or drive through flood water
- Turn off AC if instructed (prevents damage to the system)

### Do Not

- ❌ Go outside during the eye of the storm
- ❌ Use candles (fire risk during high winds)
- ❌ Open doors or windows on the windward side
- ❌ Attempt roof repairs during the storm

## After the Storm: Immediate Response

### Safety Assessment (First Hour)

1. **Wait for all-clear** from local authorities
2. **Check for injuries** and call 911 if needed
3. **Assess structural damage** from outside before entering
4. **Watch for downed power lines**—never touch or approach them
5. **Smell for gas**—if present, leave immediately and call utility company
