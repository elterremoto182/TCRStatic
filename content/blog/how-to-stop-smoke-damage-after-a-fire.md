## Step 1: Check Safety and Inspect Damage

In the first 24–48 hours after a fire, safety should be your top priority. Never enter a [Fire Restoration](/services/fire-restoration/) without proper clearance from the authorities.

### Safety Rules Before Entry

Before stepping inside, make sure you have official clearance from fire officials.

> "When entering buildings damaged by flood or fire, your personal safety is always the highest priority"

Here’s what to look out for:

| **Safety Check** | **Warning Signs** | **Action Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Structural Integrity | Leaning walls, sagging roof, foundation cracks | Wait for a professional inspection |
| Utilities | Exposed wires, gas smell, water leaks | Keep utilities off; call service providers |
| [Air Quality Inspections](/services/air-quality-inspections/) | Visible smoke, strong odors | Ensure proper ventilation |
| Entry Points | Colored tape, warning signs | Respect all official markings |

> "Your safety is paramount, which is why obtaining proper authorization before staying in your house after a fire isn’t optional"

**Protective Gear You’ll Need:**

-   N95 mask or respirator
-   Heavy-duty gloves
-   Steel-toed boots
-   Safety goggles
-   Long-sleeve shirt and pants

Stick to battery-powered flashlights for lighting – avoid open flames or anything electrical.

### Record All Damage

Documenting the damage is essential for insurance claims and planning restoration efforts. Start by photographing everything, inside and out.

Here’s how to organize it:

1.  **Photograph Everything**  
    Capture clear images of all affected areas. Focus on soot, discoloration, and structural damage, and make sure your photos include timestamps.
2.  **Compile an Inventory**  
    Create a detailed list of damaged items, including:
    -   Brand names and model numbers
    -   Purchase dates and estimated values
    -   The extent of the damage
    -   Where the items were located
3.  **Collect Supporting Documents**  
    Gather any relevant paperwork, such as:
    -   Fire department damage reports
    -   Receipts for damaged items
    -   Digital copies of important documents, if available

Don’t forget to check for smoke damage in less obvious places, such as:

-   Inside cabinets and drawers
-   HVAC systems and air ducts
-   Electronics and appliances
-   Upholstery and other textile surfaces

Once everything is documented, focus on improving ventilation and begin safe cleaning to prevent further deterioration.

## Step 2: Clear Air and Clean Surfaces

Start by ensuring proper ventilation to prevent soot from settling deeper into surfaces.

### Set Up Proper Airflow

Creating good airflow is essential:

-   **Create Positive Pressure**: Place a large fan outside your front door, directing air inward. Close all windows and doors except for one window at the opposite end of your home. This setup pushes fresh air inside while forcing smoky air out.
-   **Position Fans Strategically**: Place fans in corners, directing airflow toward doors or windows. Remove window screens to improve air circulation.

> "Good airflow helps combat the odor of smoke after a fire. If the weather allows, open your windows and use fans to keep fresh air moving throughout your home. Ventilation helps dissipate odors and dry out moisture caused by the fire-extinguishing process."  
> – (https://atirestoration.com/)

### Remove Soot Safely

Act quickly to clean soot, as it can embed itself deeper into surfaces over time. Make sure to protect yourself by wearing an N95 mask, chemical-resistant gloves, safety goggles, and long sleeves.

Start with dry cleaning methods before moving on to wet cleaning:

-   **Vacuuming Loose Soot**: Use a HEPA vacuum to remove loose soot. Keep the nozzle slightly off the surface to avoid pushing soot further into the material.
-   **Tailored Cleaning for Different Surfaces**: Each material requires a specific cleaning approach. Here’s a quick guide:

| Surface Type | Cleaning Method | Recommended Products |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Walls** | Use a dry cleaning sponge in overlapping strokes | Chemical sponge, TSP-PF |
| **Wood Furniture** | Wipe with a water-vinegar solution | Wood restoration cleaner |
| **Metal Surfaces** | Rinse with cold water, then scrub | (https://barkeepersfriend.com/) |
| **Fabrics/Carpet** | Dry vacuum first, then spot clean | Dry cleaning fluid |
| **Brick** | Apply a vinegar solution and scrub with baking soda | White vinegar and baking soda |

> "The most common way to remove fire soot damage is to clean soot stains thoroughly with a gentle solution."

## Step 3: Remove Odors and Clean Air

Once you’ve tackled the soot and improved ventilation, the next step is getting rid of stubborn smoke odors.

### Basic Odor Removal Steps

Start with simple, natural methods before moving on to more advanced solutions.

**Use Odor Absorbers**

-   Place bowls of activated charcoal in the affected areas to trap odors.
-   Sprinkle baking soda in spots where the smell is strongest.
-   Let these sit for several days to absorb odor molecules effectively.

**Natural Cleaning Solutions**

For washable items, add 1 cup of white vinegar to your regular detergent. This can help neutralize smoke odors in items like:

-   Curtains
-   Bedding
-   Clothing
-   Furniture covers

Here’s a quick guide for treating different surfaces naturally:

| Surface Type | Treatment | Application Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Carpets | Baking Soda | Sprinkle, leave overnight, then vacuum |
| Hard Surfaces | Vinegar Solution | Wipe with a 1:1 water-vinegar mixture |
| Fabrics | White Vinegar | Add to the wash cycle |
| Furniture | Activated Charcoal | Place bowls nearby |
| Walls | TSP Solution | Gently scrub with trisodium phosphate mix |

If natural methods don’t fully address the problem, professional-grade tools can take over.

### Professional Air Cleaning Tools

When basic solutions aren’t enough, it’s time to turn to advanced air cleaning equipment.

**Air Purification Systems**

Industrial air purifiers with dual filtration systems are highly effective:

-   HEPA filters capture 99.97% of fine particles.
-   Activated carbon filters absorb odor-causing molecules.
-   Run these purifiers continuously until the odors are gone.

> "Homeowners may need to hire a professional to use an ozone generator to destroy the smoke molecules left behind after a fire… This isn’t something homeowners should do themselves. There are significant health and property dangers associated with ozone. Check with your insurance company to see if this is covered under your policy. Using an ozone generator will require the temporary evacuation of your home."
> 
> -   Gina Peek, assistant director, Oklahoma State University Extension/Family Consumer Science program leader

**HVAC System Attention**

Your heating and cooling system can harbor smoke particles, so don’t overlook it:

-   Install HEPA-grade filters (usually $10–$15 each).
-   Have your air ducts professionally cleaned.
-   Set your system to recirculate mode while treating odors.

For a DIY approach, you can build a (https://www.webmd.com/allergies/corsi-rosenthal-box) using four MERV 13 filters. This setup offers a Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) of about 400. However, for extensive smoke damage, [Miramar restoration services](/miramar-restoration-services/) are often the best way to ensure complete odor removal. These services use specialized equipment and techniques to restore the air quality in your home.

## FAQs

### How can I address smoke damage in hidden areas like HVAC systems or inside cabinets?

If you find smoke damage lurking in hidden spots like your HVAC system or inside cabinets, it’s important to act fast to avoid bigger problems down the line. Start by airing out the space: open up windows and doors to bring in fresh air, and use fans to push the smoke-filled air outside.

For your HVAC system, the first step is to replace all air filters right away to prevent smoke particles from circulating. Hold off on using the system until it’s been professionally inspected and cleaned. When it comes to cabinets or other hard-to-reach areas, give all surfaces a good wipe-down with a cleaner made specifically for smoke damage. A **HEPA vacuum** can also help by pulling out those tiny, stubborn particles.

If the damage seems overwhelming or the smoky smell just won’t go away, it might be time to call in a professional restoration service. Acting quickly can make a big difference in reducing long-term damage and getting your home or business back to how it was before.

### What steps should I take to ensure my smoke damage insurance claim is processed quickly and smoothly?

To get your smoke damage insurance claim processed without unnecessary delays, start by **documenting the damage thoroughly**. As soon as it’s safe, take clear photos and videos of all the affected areas. This visual evidence will play a key role in backing up your claim.

Next, take steps to **protect your property from further damage**. This might mean boarding up broken windows or [Roof Tarping](/services/roof-tarping/) to seal off exposed areas. Once that’s done, contact your insurance company right away to report the damage and initiate the claims process. Make sure to review your policy to understand what’s covered, and keep **detailed records** of every communication, expense, and repair tied to the claim.

By staying organized and acting quickly, you can help ensure the process moves forward smoothly, letting you focus on getting your property back to normal.

### When should I call professional restoration services for smoke damage, and what can I expect from their help?

Their expertise is also crucial if water was used to put out the fire, as they can tackle water damage and help prevent mold from developing.
