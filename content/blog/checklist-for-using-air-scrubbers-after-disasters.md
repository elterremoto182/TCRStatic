## Safety Precautions and Preparation

Before starting up any air scrubber equipment, it’s crucial to establish safety measures to protect workers and property owners from harmful contaminants. Disaster-stricken areas often present a variety of hazards, so a careful evaluation and preparation process is essential before beginning air filtration tasks.

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

Wearing the right protective gear is non-negotiable in contaminated environments. Here’s what you need:

-   **N-95 respirator masks**: These masks filter out at least 95% of airborne particles, including mold and dust. For areas with severe contamination, **P-100 respirators** are a better option, offering 99.97% filtration efficiency and enhanced protection against fine particles.
-   **Nitrile gloves**: These gloves are resistant to punctures and chemicals, making them ideal for handling contaminated equipment or filters. Opt for full-coverage nitrile gloves to ensure no skin contact.
-   **Safety goggles with side shields**: These protect your eyes from debris and keep contaminants out of your tear ducts. Regular glasses or sunglasses won’t cut it since they don’t provide full coverage.
-   **Disposable coveralls or protective clothing**: A barrier between your skin and contaminated surfaces is critical. (https://www.dupont.com/personal-protection/tyvek-industrial-ppe.html) suits work well for most situations, but chemical-resistant suits are necessary in areas with chemical hazards. Always wear long sleeves and pants, even in hot weather, to reduce skin exposure.
-   **Non-slip work boots**: Closed-toe boots with rubber soles protect against debris, wet surfaces, and electrical hazards. Rubber soles also improve traction and provide insulation when working near power sources.

### Site Inspection and Hazard Assessment

Once properly equipped, conduct a detailed site inspection to identify risks and ensure safe operation.

-   **Structural integrity**: Check for sagging ceilings, cracked walls, or unstable floors, as air scrubbers weigh between 50–150 pounds. Ensure the area can handle both the weight and vibrations of the equipment.
-   [**Water Damage Clean Up**](/water-damage-clean-up/): Look for standing water, wet electrical outlets, damaged wiring, or water stains. Even seemingly dry areas may hide moisture, which can lead to mold growth.
-   [**Indoor Air Quality**](/services/indoor-air-quality): Use particle counters or air quality monitors to measure contamination levels before starting. This data helps determine where to place the air scrubber and how long it should run.
-   **Ventilation pathways**: Examine doors, windows, vents, and other openings. Seal unnecessary gaps to prevent contaminated air from escaping or clean air from entering.
-   **Asbestos and lead paint**: Older buildings (pre-1980) may contain these hazardous materials. If suspected, professional testing and containment must be done before proceeding with air scrubbers.

### Electrical Safety Guidelines

After assessing hazards, ensure all electrical systems are safe for use.

-   **Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) outlets**: These outlets shut off power if they detect electrical current leakage, reducing the risk of electrocution. If GFCI outlets aren’t available, use portable GFCI adapters.
-   **Power source inspection**: Check outlets, panels, and extension cords for signs of water damage, corrosion, or physical wear. Damaged components should be replaced, and a qualified electrician should inspect the system before use.
-   **Extension cords**: Use heavy-duty, three-prong grounded cords rated for the air scrubber’s amperage. For devices drawing 8–15 amps, 12- or 14-gauge cords are recommended. Avoid connecting multiple cords together, as this increases fire risks.
-   **Circuit capacity**: Make sure circuits can handle the air scrubber’s power needs without overloading. A standard 15-amp household circuit can typically support one air scrubber and minimal additional equipment. Multiple units may require separate circuits.
-   **Wet location precautions**: Keep all electrical connections at least 3 feet away from standing water or leaks. Use waterproof covers for outlets and route cords away from wet areas. If water levels rise, shut off power immediately and move equipment to a dry location.

## Step-by-Step Air Scrubber Setup

Once you’ve addressed all safety precautions, it’s time to set up your air scrubber. Proper positioning and configuration are key to capturing pollutants and improving the air quality in your space.

### Where to Place Air Scrubbers

Placement plays a big role in how well an air scrubber performs. Position the unit as close as possible to the main source of contamination. Make sure the unit’s *Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR)* is appropriate for the room’s size to ensure efficient purification. Pay attention to the room’s natural airflow patterns and place the scrubber where it can effectively intake polluted air. Additionally, leave enough space around the unit for unobstructed air intake and exhaust. A well-thought-out placement ensures the scrubber operates at its best.

### Creating Containment Zones

To prevent contaminated air from spreading to clean areas, set up a containment zone. Use barriers to seal off unnecessary openings and control airflow between the treatment area and adjacent spaces. Always follow professional guidelines or the manufacturer’s instructions to create an effective containment zone that isolates the problem area.

### Powering On and Adjusting Settings

Once placement and containment are sorted, power on the air scrubber following the manufacturer’s directions. Double-check that all filters are securely in place and the electrical connections are stable. Adjust the settings to ensure the unit draws in contaminated air and releases purified air where needed. Keep an eye on the scrubber’s performance and make adjustments as necessary to maintain optimal air quality during the restoration process. Regular monitoring is essential to ensure the unit works efficiently throughout its operation.

## Operating and Monitoring Air Scrubbers

Once your air scrubber is installed, the real work begins. Proper operation and consistent monitoring are key to ensuring the equipment effectively removes contaminants and maintains safe air quality during the restoration process.

### Continuous Operation for Consistent Air Quality

Keep air scrubbers running continuously until air quality tests confirm safe levels. This is especially critical when dealing with mold spores, smoke particles, or volatile organic compounds (VOCs), as these can quickly recontaminate the air if filtration is interrupted. Air scrubbers designed for extended use will perform reliably when properly maintained.

Pay close attention to performance indicators like lights or gauges, as well as the power supply. These can alert you to issues such as clogged filters or electrical problems that could disrupt continuous operation.

### Filter Maintenance and Replacement

To keep your air scrubber working efficiently, regular filter maintenance is essential.

Check filters daily while the equipment is in use. Pre-filters, which trap larger debris and particles, typically require the most frequent attention. Many pre-filters can be cleaned by vacuuming with a soft brush attachment or washing with mild soap and water – just make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Always allow washed filters to dry completely before reinstalling them.

HEPA filters and activated carbon filters, on the other hand, generally need to be replaced rather than cleaned. HEPA filters lose their effectiveness when clogged with fine particles, while carbon filters become saturated with odors and chemicals over time. Stick to the manufacturer’s recommended replacement schedule or replace filters when performance indicators show reduced airflow.

Keep a log of filter changes, noting dates and operating hours, and always have spare filters on hand to avoid unnecessary downtime.

If you’re working in areas contaminated with mold or sewage, be sure to disinfect internal components during filter changes. Use only manufacturer-approved disinfectants to prevent the spread of spores or lingering odors inside the equipment.

### Air Quality Testing and Verification

Testing air quality at different stages of the process ensures that contaminants are effectively removed. This step not only protects workers and occupants but also provides documentation of the restoration’s success.

Begin with baseline tests to establish the initial levels of contaminants.

Conduct interim tests while the air scrubber is running to monitor progress. Air quality should steadily improve as contaminants are filtered out. If test results plateau, it may indicate clogged filters, poor containment, or that the scrubber’s capacity is insufficient for the space.

Perform a final air quality test to confirm that the restoration is complete. Make sure all contamination levels meet established safety standards before shutting down the air scrubber or removing containment barriers. Keep detailed records of all air quality testing – include dates, times, locations, and specific readings – to demonstrate the effectiveness of your efforts and to safeguard against any future disputes.
