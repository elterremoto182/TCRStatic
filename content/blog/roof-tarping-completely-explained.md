## Step 1: Damage Assessment and Safety Preparations

Before the tarp goes on, our restoration professionals follow a strict safety and evaluation protocol:

### 1\. **Initial Damage Evaluation**

We begin by assessing the visible damage from the ground and, if safe, from a ladder. This includes looking for:

-   Missing or broken shingles
    
-   Holes or punctures
    
-   Warped or sagging areas
    
-   Soft spots that indicate water saturation
    

### 2\. **Clearing Roof Debris**

The next step is to remove any loose debris to prevent further damage and ensure the tarp lays flat. This can include:

-   Tree limbs and branches
    
-   Leaves and moss
    
-   Shingles or tile fragments
    
-   Windblown debris like garbage or construction material
    

Clearing the roof not only protects your tarp but prevents sharp or heavy debris from puncturing it or making the roof surface unstable.

## Step 2: Leak Containment and Temporary Patching

If a **leak is actively dripping water inside your home**, we may use **plywood** or other underlayment materials to contain it. This serves as an additional barrier beneath the tarp and protects your ceiling and interior from immediate water damage.

We’ll also ensure that any exposed areas are completely dry before installing the tarp to reduce the risk of **mold growth** underneath.

* * *

## Step 3: Measuring and Sizing the Tarp

A proper tarp installation begins with **accurate measurements**. A roof tarp should:

-   Fully cover the damaged section of the roof
    
-   Extend **at least 4 feet past** the damage in all directions
    
-   Overlap the **roof ridge** to prevent water from running under it
    
-   Hang past the **eaves** to direct water off the structure
    

Choosing a tarp that’s too small will result in leaks, while one that’s too large may be difficult to secure in windy conditions.

* * *

## Step 4: Safety Considerations (Especially for Homeowners)

**Important:** We do *not* recommend climbing onto a damaged or wet roof without professional training and proper safety gear. Slippery surfaces, hidden structural weaknesses, and loose debris can turn a roof into a dangerous environment.

### If you must inspect your roof:

-   Use a stable extension ladder with someone spotting you
    
-   Wear non-slip work boots
    
-   Use thick gloves and long-sleeved protective clothing
    
-   Wear safety goggles
    
-   Never walk on a roof if it is visibly sagging, cracked, or saturated
    

* * *

## Step 5: The Roof Tarp Installation Process

Once the roof is prepped, dry, and measured, the installation begins:

### 1\. **Securing Anchor Boards**

Pressure-treated lumber is screwed around the damaged area, anchoring the tarp in place. These boards serve two purposes:

-   Keeping the tarp tight and wrinkle-free
    
-   Preventing wind from lifting or shifting the tarp
    

### 2\. **Tarp Application**

The tarp is wrapped around the anchor boards and stretched across the roof surface, pulled **as tight as possible**. A second layer of lumber may be added on top of the tarp edges for extra wind resistance.

### 3\. **Fastening the Tarp**

We use **deck screws**, preferably into the **roof rafters**, to avoid compromising the roof deck. In high-risk areas, we also use **rubber washers** to create a watertight seal around screws. This protects the roof structure from further leaks.

* * *

## What Type of Tarp Is Used?

We use **heavy-duty polyethylene tarps**, typically:

-   Waterproof and UV-resistant
    
-   Reinforced with grommets and double-layered edges
    
-   Available in various sizes (usually 20×20, 30×40, or larger)
    
-   Designed to withstand wind and rain for weeks or months
    

* * *

## How Long Does a Roof Tarp Last?

A properly installed tarp can last **up to 90 days**, depending on weather conditions. However, tarps are **not a permanent solution**—they are designed to give you time to:

-   Schedule a roofing contractor
    
-   File an insurance claim
    
-   Avoid further structural damage
    
-   Protect your interior while permanent repairs are made
    

* * *

## Insurance and Roof Tarping

Most homeowner’s insurance policies **cover emergency tarping services**, especially if the damage was caused by a covered peril (e.g., storm, fire, tree fall). You should:

-   Document the damage with photos
    
-   Keep receipts from any tarp-related work
    
-   Contact your insurance company promptly
    

We work directly with many insurance companies and can help streamline the claim process for you.
