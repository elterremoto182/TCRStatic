## The Reality of Storm Chaser Scams

After every major hurricane or storm in South Florida, predatory contractors descend on affected areas. These "storm chasers" or "roofer rats" prey on vulnerable homeowners desperate to repair their homes. Understanding their tactics helps you protect yourself and your property.

According to the National Insurance Crime Bureau, contractor fraud increases dramatically after natural disasters. Florida, with its frequent hurricanes, is particularly targeted.

## Common Storm Chaser Tactics

### Door-to-Door Solicitation

The most common approach:

- Show up uninvited immediately after storms
- Claim to be "in the neighborhood doing work"
- Offer free inspections to find damage
- Pressure you to sign contracts on the spot
- May claim damage you didn't know existed

**Red Flag**: Legitimate contractors don't typically solicit door-to-door. If you didn't call them, be skeptical.

### High-Pressure Sales Tactics

Storm chasers often:

- Create false urgency ("This price is only good today")
- Claim limited availability ("We're only in the area this week")
- Use fear tactics ("Your whole roof could collapse")
- Discourage you from getting other estimates
- Push you to sign before you've had time to think

### Assignment of Benefits (AOB) Abuse

A particularly problematic tactic in Florida:

- Ask you to sign over insurance benefits to them
- Handle your entire insurance claim
- May inflate claims or file fraudulent paperwork
- Leave you responsible if insurance disputes arise

**Important**: In 2022, Florida reformed AOB laws, but be cautious with anyone asking you to sign over benefits.

### The "Free Roof" Pitch

A classic scam approach:

- Promise to get you a free roof through insurance
- Offer to waive your deductible (illegal in Florida)
- Inflate the scope of work on insurance claims
- This is insurance fraud, and you could be liable

### Low-Ball Estimates Then Add Charges

The bait-and-switch:

- Provide unrealistically low initial estimate
- Begin work, then "discover" additional problems
- Claim the original estimate was only partial
- Demand more money to complete the job
- May threaten to place liens on your property

## Warning Signs of Scam Contractors

### Identification Red Flags
- No permanent business address
- Out-of-state license plates
- No local business license
- Unable to provide proof of insurance
- No references from local customers
- Company name doesn't appear in online searches

### Business Practice Red Flags
- Demands cash payments only
- Wants full payment before work begins
- No written contract or vague contracts
- Pressures you to sign immediately
- Discourages you from reading contracts fully
- Won't provide a copy of their license

### Insurance Red Flags
- Offers to waive your deductible
- Asks you to sign a blank claim form

## How to Verify Contractors

### Check State Licensing

Florida contractors must be licensed. Verify at:

- **Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation**: [myfloridalicense.com](https://www.myfloridalicense.com/wl11.asp)
- Search by company name or license number
- Verify the license is active and covers your work type
- Check for complaints or disciplinary actions

### Verify Insurance

Legitimate contractors carry:

- General liability insurance
- Workers' compensation insurance
- Ask for certificates of insurance
- Call the insurance company to verify coverage
- Ensure coverage is current, not expired

### Local Verification
- Check with your local Chamber of Commerce
- Search Better Business Bureau listings
- Look for Google reviews and local references
- Ask neighbors who they've used
- Check local contractor associations

### Background Research
- Search for the company name + "complaints" or "scam"
- Look for news articles about the company
- Check court records for lawsuits
- Verify the physical business address exists
- Call the business number before they arrive

## What to Do When Approached

If a contractor shows up unsolicited:

### Don't
- Don't sign anything immediately
- Don't give them access to your roof unsupervised
- Don't pay any money upfront
- Don't share your insurance policy details
- Don't make decisions under pressure

### Do
- Get their business card and license number
- Say you need time to research and compare
- Ask for written estimate only (no contracts)
- Take photos of their vehicle and ID
- Trust your instincts—if it feels wrong, it probably is

## Hiring the Right Contractor
