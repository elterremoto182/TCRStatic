## Living with Storm Risk in Florida

Florida's location makes it uniquely vulnerable to tropical weather. Hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30, but tropical systems can develop any time. Beyond hurricanes, Florida experiences frequent thunderstorms, tornadoes, and flooding events that can damage property.

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about preparing for storms, protecting your property during severe weather, and recovering from storm damage.

## Types of Storm Damage

Storms cause damage in several ways, often in combination:

### Wind Damage

Wind damage can occur at relatively low speeds and increases dramatically as winds intensify:

- **Roof damage**: Shingles, tiles, or panels lifted, broken, or blown off
- **Structural damage**: Walls, soffits, and fascia damaged by wind pressure
- **Falling debris**: Trees, branches, and airborne objects striking structures
- **Window and door damage**: Glass breakage and frame damage
- **Fence and screen enclosure damage**: Often among the first casualties

### Water Intrusion

Water enters buildings in multiple ways during storms:

- **Roof leaks**: Through damaged or missing roofing materials
- **Window and door leaks**: Wind-driven rain through seals and frames
- **Rising water**: Storm surge or flooding from heavy rain
- **Hydrostatic pressure**: Groundwater pushing through foundations

### Flooding

Flooding presents unique challenges:

- **Storm surge**: Seawater pushed inland by hurricane winds
- **Flash flooding**: Overwhelming drainage systems during heavy rain
- **River and lake flooding**: Water bodies overflowing their banks
- **Tidal flooding**: King tides combined with storm conditions

### Secondary Damage

Storm damage often leads to additional problems:

- **Mold growth**: Can begin within 24-48 hours of water intrusion
- **Structural deterioration**: Ongoing damage from exposed elements
- **Pest intrusion**: Insects and animals entering through openings
- **Theft and vandalism**: In unsecured properties

## Hurricane Categories and Expected Damage

Understanding the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale helps you prepare appropriately:

### Category 1 (74-95 mph)

- Minor roof damage, loose outdoor items blown around
- Some tree damage, primarily branches
- Power outages possible but usually brief

### Category 2 (96-110 mph)

- Significant roof damage to shingles and tiles
- Trees uprooted, especially shallow-rooted species
- Extended power outages likely

### Category 3 (111-129 mph) - Major Hurricane

- Major roof damage, potential structural damage
- Many trees uprooted
- Water and electricity unavailable for days to weeks

### Category 4 (130-156 mph) - Major Hurricane

- Severe roof and structural damage
- Most trees snapped or uprooted
- Uninhabitable conditions for weeks to months

### Category 5 (157+ mph) - Major Hurricane

- Catastrophic damage, many homes destroyed
- Essentially all trees down
- Area uninhabitable for extended periods

## Storm Preparation

Preparation is your best defense against storm damage:

### Home Hardening

Long-term improvements that protect your property:

**Roof**:
- Hurricane straps connecting roof to walls
- Impact-resistant roofing materials
- Proper installation and maintenance
- Secondary water barrier under roofing

**Windows and Doors**:
- Impact-resistant windows and doors
- Hurricane shutters (manual or automatic)
- Reinforced garage doors
- Entry door deadbolts and reinforcement

**Structural**:
- Foundation anchor bolts
- Reinforced wall connections
- Proper construction to current Florida Building Code

### Before Hurricane Season (June 1)

Annual preparation should include:

- Review and update insurance coverage
- Document your property with photos and video
- Stock emergency supplies
- Test generators and hurricane shutters
- Trim trees and remove dead branches
- Clear gutters and drains
- Identify your evacuation zone and routes

### When a Storm Threatens

As a storm approaches:

**72 Hours Out**:
- Monitor the storm's progress
- Review your emergency plan
- Begin securing outdoor items
- Top off vehicle fuel

**48 Hours Out**:
- Install hurricane shutters
- Secure or store outdoor furniture, plants, and decorations
- Fill bathtubs and containers with water
- Get cash (ATMs may not work after storm)
- Charge devices and backup batteries

**24 Hours Out**:
- Complete all preparations
- Move vehicles to protected areas
- Turn refrigerator and freezer to coldest settings
- Know how to turn off utilities
- Evacuate if ordered or if you're in an evacuation zone

## Emergency Roof Protection

If your roof is damaged during a storm, temporary protection prevents additional damage:

### Roof Tarping

Professional roof tarping provides emergency weatherproofing:

**Why Professional Tarping Matters**:
- Proper coverage of damaged areas
- Secure attachment that won't blow off
- Correct overlap and sealing techniques
- Safe installation by trained crews

**How Long Tarps Last**:
- Quality installation: 30-90 days typically
- Depends on weather conditions and tarp quality
- Not a permanent solution—repair should follow

**What to Expect**:
- 24/7 emergency response available
- Assessment of damage and tarp requirements
- Installation by trained crews with safety equipment
- Documentation for insurance claims

### Shrink Wrapping

For longer-term protection or complex roof geometries:

- Heat-sealed waterproof membrane
- Conforms to irregular shapes
- Lasts 6-12 months or longer
- More expensive but more durable

### Board-Up Services

Protecting openings from weather and security risks:

- Windows and doors secured with plywood or polycarbonate
- Prevents water intrusion
- Deters theft and vandalism
- Required by many insurance policies

## Post-Storm Safety

After a storm passes, safety is the priority:

### Before Returning Home

- Wait for official all-clear from authorities
- Watch for road hazards, flooding, and downed power lines
- Don't drive through standing water
- Have your property inspected before occupying if possible

### Initial Assessment

When you first return:

- Photograph damage before any cleanup
- Check for structural damage before entering
- Watch for hazards: gas leaks, electrical damage, weakened structures
- Document everything for insurance

### Immediate Concerns

Address these issues first:

**Safety Hazards**:
- Downed power lines
- Gas leaks
- Standing water with electrical sources
- Unstable structures

**Preventing Additional Damage**:
- Temporary roof covering
- Boarding windows and openings
- Water extraction if flooding occurred
- Removing debris from against the structure

## Flood Damage Restoration

Flood damage requires special consideration:

### Flood Water Categories

**Category 3 (Black Water)**: Most flood water is considered Category 3—highly contaminated with sewage, chemicals, and biological hazards. This includes:

- Storm surge and seawater
- River and lake overflow
- Overflowing sewers and septic systems
- Standing water that has become stagnant

### Flood Restoration Process

1. **Safety assessment**: Ensure the property is safe to enter
2. **Documentation**: Photograph all damage for insurance
3. **Water extraction**: Remove standing water
4. **Debris removal**: Remove damaged materials and debris
5. **Cleaning and sanitization**: Disinfect all affected surfaces
6. **Structural drying**: Professional drying to prevent mold
7. **Reconstruction**: Restore the property

### What Can't Be Saved After Flooding

Category 3 water contamination means many materials must be discarded:

- Carpet and padding
- Drywall (at least 12" above water line)
- Insulation that got wet
- Upholstered furniture
- Mattresses and bedding
- Particle board furniture
- Food and medications

## Storm Damage Insurance Claims

Navigating insurance after a storm requires preparation and persistence:

### Understanding Your Coverage

**Homeowners Insurance** typically covers:
- Wind damage to structure and contents
- Rain damage through wind-created openings
- Falling trees and debris
- Additional living expenses if displaced

**Flood Insurance** (separate policy, usually through NFIP) covers:
- Rising water damage
- Storm surge
- Mudslides related to flooding

**Hurricane Deductibles**:
- Usually a percentage of home's insured value (1-10%)
- Applied per hurricane season, not per claim
- Much higher than standard deductibles

### Filing Your Claim

1. **Report promptly**: Contact your insurer as soon as safely possible
2. **Document thoroughly**: Photos, videos, written descriptions
3. **Make temporary repairs**: Prevent additional damage (keep receipts)
4. **Don't discard**: Keep damaged items until adjuster inspection
5. **Get multiple estimates**: For comparison and leverage
6. **Track everything**: Create a claim file with all communications

### Working with Adjusters

- Be present for all inspections
- Point out all damage, including hidden areas
- Provide documentation of pre-loss condition
- Ask questions and take notes
- Get everything in writing

### If Your Claim Is Denied or Underpaid

- Request a detailed explanation
- Provide additional documentation
- Consider a second opinion on damage extent
- Consult a public adjuster
- Know your policy's dispute resolution process

## Avoiding Storm Chasers and Scams

After major storms, scammers target affected areas:

### Warning Signs

- Unsolicited door-to-door contractors
- "Today only" high-pressure tactics
- Requests for large deposits
- Out-of-area license plates
