## Living with Storm Risk in Florida

![Florida storm surge flooding during hurricane season showing coastal damage](/images/blog/2026/01/florida-storm-surge.jpg)

Florida's location makes it uniquely vulnerable to tropical weather. According to [NOAA](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/), Florida faces an average of **7 hurricanes per decade** making landfall or passing nearby. Hurricane damage has averaged over **$20 billion annually** in the US over the past decade, with Florida bearing a significant portion of these losses.

Hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30, but tropical systems can develop any time. Beyond hurricanes, Florida experiences frequent thunderstorms, tornadoes, and flooding events that can damage property. Hailstorms alone cause around **$1 billion in damage every year** across the United States.

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about preparing for storms, protecting your property during severe weather, and recovering from storm damage.

## Types of Storm Damage

Storms cause damage in several ways, often in combination:

### Wind Damage

[Wind damage](/problems/wind-damage-restoration/) can occur at relatively low speeds and increases dramatically as winds intensify:

- **[Roof damage](/problems/hurricane-roof-damage/)**: Shingles, tiles, or panels lifted, broken, or blown off
- **Structural damage**: Walls, soffits, and fascia damaged by wind pressure
- **[Falling debris](/problems/tree-damage-restoration/)**: Trees, branches, and airborne objects striking structures
- **Window and door damage**: Glass breakage and frame damage
- **Fence and screen enclosure damage**: Often among the first casualties

### Water Intrusion

Water enters buildings in multiple ways during storms:

- **[Roof leaks](/problems/hurricane-roof-damage/)**: Through damaged or missing roofing materials
- **Window and door leaks**: Wind-driven rain through seals and frames
- **[Rising water](/problems/hurricane-flood-damage/)**: Storm surge or flooding from heavy rain
- **Hydrostatic pressure**: Groundwater pushing through foundations

### Flooding

[Hurricane flooding](/problems/hurricane-flood-damage/) presents unique challenges:

- **Storm surge**: Seawater pushed inland by hurricane winds
- **Flash flooding**: Overwhelming drainage systems during heavy rain
- **River and lake flooding**: Water bodies overflowing their banks
- **Tidal flooding**: King tides combined with storm conditions

### Secondary Damage

Storm damage often leads to additional problems:

- **Mold growth**: Can begin within 24-48 hours of water intrusion
- **Structural deterioration**: Ongoing damage from exposed elements
- **Pest intrusion**: Insects and animals entering through openings
- **Theft and vandalism**: In unsecured properties

Understanding the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale helps you prepare appropriately:

### Category 1 (74-95 mph)

- Minor roof damage, loose outdoor items blown around
- Some tree damage, primarily branches
- Power outages possible but usually brief

### Category 2 (96-110 mph)

- Significant roof damage to shingles and tiles
- Trees uprooted, especially shallow-rooted species
- Extended power outages likely

### Category 3 (111-129 mph) - Major Hurricane

- Major roof damage, potential structural damage
- Many trees uprooted
- Water and electricity unavailable for days to weeks

### Category 4 (130-156 mph) - Major Hurricane

- Severe roof and structural damage
- Most trees snapped or uprooted
- Uninhabitable conditions for weeks to months

### Category 5 (157+ mph) - Major Hurricane

## Emergency Roof Protection

![Professional installing emergency roof tarp after storm damage](/images/blog/2021/10/installing-a-roof-tarp-e1595882236151-1-e1635367691497.jpeg)

If your roof is damaged during a storm, temporary protection prevents additional damage:

### Roof Tarping

Professional roof tarping provides emergency weatherproofing:

**Why Professional Tarping Matters**:
- Proper coverage of damaged areas
- Secure attachment that won't blow off
- Correct overlap and sealing techniques
- Safe installation by trained crews

**How Long Tarps Last**:
- Quality installation: 30-90 days typically
- Depends on weather conditions and tarp quality
- Not a permanent solution—repair should follow

**What to Expect**:
- 24/7 emergency response available
- Assessment of damage and tarp requirements
- Installation by trained crews with safety equipment
- Documentation for insurance claims

### Shrink Wrapping

![Shrink wrap roof protection providing longer-term weatherproofing](/images/blog/2021/11/1st-roof-wrap.jpg)

For longer-term protection or complex roof geometries:

- Heat-sealed waterproof membrane
- Conforms to irregular shapes
- Lasts 6-12 months or longer
- More expensive but more durable

### Board-Up Services

Protecting openings from weather and security risks:

- Windows and doors secured with plywood or polycarbonate
- Prevents water intrusion
- Deters theft and vandalism
- Required by many insurance policies

## Storm Damage Restoration Costs

Understanding costs helps you budget and recognize fair pricing. Acting quickly can save thousands—a **$500 repair can balloon to $10,000+** if left unattended due to water damage, mold growth, and structural deterioration.

### Emergency Roof Protection Costs

| Service | Cost Range |
|---------|-----------|
| **Emergency Roof Tarping** (professional) | $750 - $4,200 |
| **DIY Tarp Materials** (1,500 sq ft roof) | $150 - $350 |
| **Shrink Wrapping** | $1,500 - $6,000 |
| **Temporary Leak Repairs** | $300 - $1,200 |
| **Board-Up Services** | $100 - $300 per opening |

### Shrink Wrap Cost Breakdown

For shrink wrap roof protection:
- Materials: $0.10 - $1.50 per square foot
- Labor: $1 - $3 per square foot
- **Total: $1 - $4 per square foot**

For a 1,500 sq ft roof area, expect $1,500 - $6,000 depending on complexity.

### Factors That Affect Roof Protection Costs

- **Roof size and pitch**: Steeper roofs require more labor
- **Extent of damage**: Larger damaged areas need more materials
- **Accessibility**: Multi-story homes cost more
- **Time of service**: Emergency/after-hours rates may apply
- **Demand after storms**: Prices may increase temporarily

### When to Act

**Temporary leak repairs**: $300 - $1,200
**Ignoring the problem**: Water damage and [mold remediation](/mold-remediation/) costs exceeding **$10,000**

**Replacing a few shingles**: $500 - $1,500
**Waiting until structural damage occurs**: $15,000+

The math is clear: immediate action saves money.

## Post-Storm Safety

After a storm passes, safety is the priority:

### Before Returning Home

- Wait for official all-clear from authorities
- Watch for road hazards, flooding, and downed power lines
- Don't drive through standing water
- Have your property inspected before occupying if possible

### Initial Assessment

When you first return:

- Photograph damage before any cleanup

- Watch for hazards: gas leaks, electrical damage, weakened structures
- Document everything for insurance

### Immediate Concerns

Address these issues first:

**Safety Hazards**:
- Downed power lines
- Gas leaks
- Standing water with electrical sources
- Unstable structures

**Preventing Additional Damage**:
- Temporary roof covering
- Boarding windows and openings
- Water extraction if flooding occurred
- Removing debris from against the structure

---

## Flood Damage Restoration

Flood damage requires special consideration:

### Flood Water Categories

**Category 3 (Black Water)**: Most flood water is considered Category 3—highly contaminated with sewage, chemicals, and biological hazards. This includes:

- Storm surge and seawater
- River and lake overflow
- Overflowing sewers and septic systems
- Standing water that has become stagnant

### Flood Restoration Process

1. **Safety assessment**: Ensure the property is safe to enter
2. **Documentation**: Photograph all damage for insurance
3. **Water extraction**: Remove standing water
4. **Debris removal**: Remove damaged materials and debris
5. **Cleaning and sanitization**: Disinfect all affected surfaces
6. **Structural drying**: Professional drying to prevent mold
7. **Reconstruction**: Restore the property

### What Can't Be Saved After Flooding

Category 3 water contamination means many materials must be discarded:

- Carpet and padding
- Drywall (at least 12" above water line)
- Insulation that got wet
- Upholstered furniture
- Mattresses and bedding
- Particle board furniture
- Food and medications

1. **Report promptly**: Contact your insurer as soon as safely possible
2. **Document thoroughly**: Photos, videos, written descriptions
3. **Make temporary repairs**: Prevent additional damage (keep receipts)
4. **Don't discard**: Keep damaged items until adjuster inspection
5. **Get multiple estimates**: For comparison and leverage
6. **Track everything**: Create a claim file with all communications

### Working with Adjusters

- Be present for all inspections
- Point out all damage, including hidden areas
- Provide documentation of pre-loss condition
- Ask questions and take notes
- Get everything in writing

### If Your Claim Is Denied or Underpaid

- Request a detailed explanation
