Hector and Junior came to our home and were incredibly professional, neat, and courteous. They took great care to protect our floors with extra coverings and padded protection, ensuring no mud or mess was tracked through the house. They efficiently set up three machines in my kitchen to address moisture issues, and their attention to detail was impressive. Both Hector and Junior were spectacular to work with, and their professionalism made the process stress-free. Thank you, Total Care Restoration, for a job well done! I’d confidently recommend this company to anyone in need of restoration services.",

Last week they helped me move items that had been stored in the shed after the flood. Today, these gentlemen helped me move the remainder of the flood items from the shed. They also moved an outdoor loveseat as well as two outdoor arm chairs from the front patio to the shed.\nRealizing both my age and being alone, Jesus and Luis took the time to help me.\nI hope management at TOTAL CARE RESTORATION is aware of both the professionalism and compassion that is exhibited by these employees. I would recommend this company with the highest regard based on your employees alone, especially these two individuals.\nAs an addendum to this recommendation, I wish to add the following. After the initial mold remediation was completed by other team members, 2 of the areas having mold failed to pass the clearance test. Again, Luis and Jesus were sent to my home. They resprayed and fogged the 2 rooms in question with such due diligence, I know with certainty all the mold has now been eradicated!  This Company follows through until everything is perfect as witnessed by all who are employed by them, especially Luis and Jesus.\n\nThank you,\nKathleen Terrell",

Everything was explained clearly to me, everything was performed professionally, everyone was superb to work with. In particular, while everyone introduced themselves to me, I remember talking with Simon, Steven and another gentleman who came yesterday with the others to remove all the machines. In addition, Kevin was exceptionally responsive and clearly outlined the process and details of work and everything regarding the claim as well. Xavier (Javier?) was also very professional and well-informed about this role in this endeavor. I was equally impressed with Raul and learned of his many years experience and expertise with regard to insurance matters. I enjoyed speaking with not only him, but found all them interesting and also experienced.  I am truly appreciative of the quality and the industriousness of all those who work for Total Care Restoration. They are excellent representatives for your company and I would not hesitate for a moment to highly recommend TCR to anyone.  Again, my sincere thanks for everything done to restore my home.  Best wishes, Lauren Christos",

We were caught off guard on several occasions regarding the process and how it was going to affect us.  Regarding punctuality, rarely did the employees arrive at the appointment time.  One time, they were 5 hours late.  Another time 2 hours.  Regarding price, the company charges very high prices for the services provided, especially the water removal.  All that was provided were some very loud fans to try to dry the cabinets.  I cannot recommend the company at all.",

This company took advantage of my landlord who lives in Europe, knowing very well she is unable to see their poor work. The people who schedule the technicians don't communicate properly and then the technicians do not show up on time. There was a FLOOD and all they did was blow hot air with big noisy fans.

    "text": "The team that arrived, Maria, Jesus & Kevin were amazing, efficient & very pleasant. Kevin, the supv, welcomed every question with patience & responded in detail. I trust them & recommend this team without reservation.\n\nI regrettably am compelled to edit my review of Total Care Restoration. My original review was requested (by Kevin) and posted at the start of the project, which lasted 14 days!   Within that 14-day period there were several inconsistencies big and small, including the (verbal) estimate I received from Kevin on day one, an important factor in my decision to hire this contractor. The estimate was between $1K- $3k, but the actual invoice was a little over $4K.  When equipment pick-ups were scheduled, I had to insist that moisture levels be verified before removing the equipment. I discovered days later that important appliances were unplugged without any notice, like my washing machine and floor lamps. None of this deserves a 5-star rating. In fairness, I should also recognize (2) exceptional workers, Yunior and Luis. They were helpful, professional and concerned about the overall success of my project. Please think twice before hiring Total Care Restoration.",

    "text": "On a Tuesday night I had a small toilet leak. By Wednesday morning I called a plumber. The plumber arrived around 4pm. A few mins after the plumber arrived, a guy from this company also arrived. He knew the plumber and they greeted each other and spoke. I never called this company so I’m assuming they’re in partnership with the plumbing company. This company came to my home without me calling them to seek money out of my insurance. I was sold on a promise that my insurance would fix and pay for any damages, at minimum $10k.  He then sent two guys to my home the next following afternoon, Thursday 4pm (48 hours after the toilet leak) and placed two fans in my home and removed one small baseboard about 2 ft long out the bathroom. That’s it!!! Now they’re trying to have me pay about $3k… My insurance even realized the damages were not worth that cost. This company is a fraud. They seeked out a young single mom, he wouldn’t have done this if I was a man. The email stated they will lower the amount, but yet they continue sending me bills for the full price. When you call their office, they forward you to the “office manager” but it’s always going to voicemail.",
