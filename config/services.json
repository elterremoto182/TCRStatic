Soot is acidic and continues to damage surfaces over time, so prompt cleaning is essential.

This includes water extraction, board-up services, emergency tarping, and temporary repairs. We document all emergency work thoroughly for insurance purposes and can bill your insurance company directly in most cases. We recommend contacting your insurance company promptly to report the incident."

Unlike tarps that are secured with straps and weights, shrink wrap conforms tightly to the surface and creates a complete seal.

          "question": "Is sewage cleanup dangerous to do myself?",
          "answer": "Yes, sewage cleanup is extremely dangerous and should only be performed by professionals. Raw sewage contains harmful bacteria (E. coli, Salmonella), viruses (Hepatitis A), parasites, and other pathogens that can cause serious illness. Professional restoration companies have proper protective equipment, hospital-grade disinfectants, and training to handle biohazardous materials safely. Attempting DIY cleanup puts you and your family at significant health risk."

        {
          "question": "How long does sewage cleanup take?",
          "answer": "Sewage cleanup typically takes 1-3 days for the initial extraction, sanitization, and drying process. Complete restoration including any necessary repairs may take 1-2 weeks depending on the extent of damage. Porous materials like carpet and drywall often need replacement. We work efficiently to restore your property while ensuring thorough decontamination—cutting corners with biohazards is never acceptable."

          "question": "What causes sewage backups?",
          "answer": "Common causes include main sewer line blockages or collapse, tree roots growing into sewer pipes, septic system failures, flushing non-flushable items, grease buildup in pipes, heavy rainfall overwhelming municipal systems, and aging plumbing infrastructure. Regular maintenance and proper usage habits can prevent many backups, but some causes like municipal system overflows are beyond homeowner control."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does insurance cover sewage cleanup?",
          "answer": "Coverage varies by policy. Most standard homeowners insurance does not cover sewage backups unless you have specific sewer and drain backup coverage added to your policy. This endorsement is relatively inexpensive and highly recommended, especially in older homes or areas with known sewer issues. We work with your insurance company and provide detailed documentation for claims when coverage applies."
