Hector and Junior came to our home and were incredibly professional, neat, and courteous. They took great care to protect our floors with extra coverings and padded protection, ensuring no mud or mess was tracked through the house. They efficiently set up three machines in my kitchen to address moisture issues, and their attention to detail was impressive. Both Hector and Junior were spectacular to work with, and their professionalism made the process stress-free. Thank you, Total Care Restoration, for a job well done!"

It's a large unit with water damage in nearly every room, but they worked late into the night and handled everything with care. Over the next week, Zack, Luis, and Yunior checked in almost daily. They were professional, knowledgeable, and genuinely cared. The unit dried out fully, and mold testing later came back clean. I was so impressed, I called them again for a separate issue at another property. Highly recommend."
